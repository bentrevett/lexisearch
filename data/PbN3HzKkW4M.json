Afghanistan at 18 years old and came home with severe PTSD.\n\n00:11.960 --> 00:16.800\n She went on to found Brass in Unity which creates unique jewellery, large part of the\n\n00:16.800 --> 00:23.160\n proceeds from which go to help rehabilitate the lives, limbs and mental health of veterans\n\n00:23.160 --> 00:25.040\n and first responders.\n\n00:25.040 --> 00:30.160\n She has a big personality, big heart and an intense passion for life.\n\n00:30.160 --> 00:35.400\n So when our paths happened to cross, I knew we needed to talk.\n\n00:35.400 --> 00:40.880\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n00:40.880 --> 00:45.520\n And now here's my conversation with Kelsey Sharon.\n\n00:45.520 --> 00:49.560\n You mentioned that studying history had a big impact on you and that your grandfather\n\n00:49.560 --> 00:52.120\n was a World War II vet.\n\n00:52.120 --> 00:55.960\n So people that have gone through World War II, in my family too, they don't seem to talk\n\n00:55.960 --> 00:56.960\n about it much.\n\n00:56.960 --> 01:00.520\n Like the worse the tragedy, the less they talk about it.\n\n01:00.520 --> 01:06.140\n I mean it's understandable, I can respect that, but I don't think people fully understood\n\n01:06.140 --> 01:13.920\n the value in human stories over time and sharing that, that certain civilizations don't have\n\n01:13.920 --> 01:15.420\n written language.\n\n01:15.420 --> 01:21.540\n The value in that being passed down is extraordinary, but we didn't really have that with the World\n\n01:21.540 --> 01:23.160\n War II vets it seems like.\n\n01:23.160 --> 01:27.240\n Well, they kind of want to protect you from the pain.\n\n01:27.240 --> 01:32.360\n My grandmother went through Holland and Moore, which is the Ukrainian starvation of millions\n\n01:32.360 --> 01:39.800\n of people, and then obviously went through World War II with the Nazi occupation.\n\n01:39.800 --> 01:46.440\n And same on the grandfather's side who, on my dad's side, grandfather fought in World\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:47.440\n War II.\n\n01:47.440 --> 01:53.280\n So they seem to not want to talk about those experiences to protect you from the suffering,\n\n01:53.280 --> 01:59.540\n to protect you from the evil that they've experienced, which is sad because the lessons\n\n01:59.540 --> 02:02.840\n from that history are not then propagated through you.\n\n02:02.840 --> 02:07.320\n And also there's something about the strength you carry with you knowing that that's in\n\n02:07.320 --> 02:08.320\n your blood.\n\n02:08.320 --> 02:11.920\n Those great heroes are in your blood and that's suffering, overcoming that suffering is in\n\n02:11.920 --> 02:12.920\n your blood.\n\n02:12.920 --> 02:15.160\n I would argue that's exactly correct.\n\n02:15.160 --> 02:20.760\n If you have someone you know that comes from your lineage that has done something super\n\n02:20.760 --> 02:26.000\n gnarly, that's just been a badass and in so many different ways, you want to know about\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:27.000\n that person.\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:28.160\n You have that person's blood in you.\n\n02:28.160 --> 02:32.680\n That's important to acknowledge and when that isn't shared, I feel like it's just a detriment\n\n02:32.680 --> 02:33.680\n to that individual.\n\n02:33.680 --> 02:36.960\n What do you make of World War II?\n\n02:36.960 --> 02:43.180\n In terms of history, do you think about those kinds of wars where two times more civilians\n\n02:43.180 --> 02:47.680\n died than the number of military personnel?\n\n02:47.680 --> 02:54.040\n So most of the war is basically just the death of civilians and the invasion of homes, the\n\n02:54.040 --> 02:57.080\n burning of homes, the bombing of homes, all of that.\n\n02:57.080 --> 03:06.720\n World War II for me, I find that was the first experience where I became just obsessed with\n\n03:06.720 --> 03:08.080\n history.\n\n03:08.080 --> 03:10.640\n World War II really did it for me.\n\n03:10.640 --> 03:17.920\n I'm not sure if it's because of the dramatization of film and TV and the way that our generation\n\n03:17.920 --> 03:21.800\n has looked at it, but for me, it was more than that.\n\n03:21.800 --> 03:28.440\n I felt a deep connection to it and I still can't figure out why, like a pull almost.\n\n03:28.440 --> 03:32.520\n People joke around about those past lives and those things or those connections and\n\n03:32.520 --> 03:38.100\n there's something deeper within me that feels a pull towards that and I'm not quite sure\n\n03:38.100 --> 03:44.280\n if it's because I had family that escaped Hungary once the Soviets came in, so thanks\n\n03:44.280 --> 03:51.840\n for that, or if it was because my grandfather served in it or for whatever reason, I have\n\n03:51.840 --> 03:52.840\n this pull to it.\n\n03:52.840 --> 03:59.840\n And so when you think about the mass casualty of the civilian population, that's very difficult\n\n03:59.840 --> 04:05.280\n for me to wrap my brain around after being in a war and seeing when you have a small\n\n04:05.280 --> 04:10.080\n subset of civilians die, how much of an impact that has on that community right there in\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:12.640\n just a tiny area.\n\n04:12.640 --> 04:17.480\n So to try to wrap my brain around what happened in Europe and all across and all of that,\n\n04:17.480 --> 04:22.680\n I really struggle with that because I don't know that I can comprehend what that would\n\n04:22.680 --> 04:28.000\n truly mean to somebody if I didn't experience it or see it for what it is.\n\n04:28.000 --> 04:29.000\n Does that make sense?\n\n04:29.000 --> 04:30.000\n Yeah.\n\n04:30.000 --> 04:34.940\n So first of all, you're right, a lot of people are drawn to World War II for different reasons.\n\n04:34.940 --> 04:43.280\n The one is Hitler and Stalin trying to understand how it's possible to have that scale of evil\n\n04:43.280 --> 04:46.160\n in very different flavors of evil.\n\n04:46.160 --> 04:49.200\n It's almost fascinating that human nature can allow for that.\n\n04:49.200 --> 04:54.200\n And then also it's fascinating that so many people can follow leaders like that with a\n\n04:54.200 --> 04:57.940\n pride and with a love of country.\n\n04:57.940 --> 05:03.800\n And that's like, it's almost like this weird experiment, it's like, wow, I wonder if I'm\n\n05:03.800 --> 05:07.920\n made from the same cloth as those people.\n\n05:07.920 --> 05:14.800\n Like would I be a good German if I lived in Germany and was, you know, during the time\n\n05:14.800 --> 05:15.800\n of Hitler?\n\n05:15.800 --> 05:21.040\n Would I believe that Germany has been done wrong, I'm Jewish by the way, which makes\n\n05:21.040 --> 05:28.120\n me a little bit more comfortable talking about this, is would I believe in the dream sold\n\n05:28.120 --> 05:34.240\n by a charismatic dictator who says that wrongs have been done and we need to correct those\n\n05:34.240 --> 05:35.240\n wrongs?\n\n05:35.240 --> 05:40.720\n That to me, this is the compelling thing that draws me to World War II, the human nature\n\n05:40.720 --> 05:41.720\n question.\n\n05:41.720 --> 05:42.880\n I would agree with you on that.\n\n05:42.880 --> 05:45.360\n I think there's a way to look at people like that.\n\n05:45.360 --> 05:50.920\n And at that time there was no real, well, there wasn't a full understanding of the psyche\n\n05:50.920 --> 05:56.520\n the way that we're starting to, I mean, we still don't understand any of it, but it seems\n\n05:56.520 --> 06:03.940\n like the time gap back then, there was no real understanding of sociopaths and narcissists\n\n06:03.940 --> 06:07.280\n and psychopaths and really what those traits were.\n\n06:07.280 --> 06:12.520\n And I feel like people will follow blindly if they're given a good enough reason.\n\n06:12.520 --> 06:18.480\n Well, if you have an individual who is ranting and screaming at the top of his lungs in the\n\n06:18.480 --> 06:23.580\n middle of these town squares and he's getting this attention, it's human nature to want\n\n06:23.580 --> 06:27.520\n to understand and be a part of a group mentality.\n\n06:27.520 --> 06:29.260\n It's human nature to want to fit in.\n\n06:29.260 --> 06:35.080\n And so I don't know if it's more of people were at the beginning were just, this is the\n\n06:35.080 --> 06:36.860\n cool thing to do.\n\n06:36.860 --> 06:40.760\n Or if it was, they were genuinely terrified.\n\n06:40.760 --> 06:44.720\n Or if there was an aspect that was like, this guy is saying something that resonates with\n\n06:44.720 --> 06:45.720\n me.\n\n06:45.720 --> 06:47.080\n There could be a lot of different things.\n\n06:47.080 --> 06:54.720\n I think it's unfortunate that we didn't get to, or no one got to really examine this individual's\n\n06:54.720 --> 06:58.680\n brain and this person and why they thought the way they thought.\n\n06:58.680 --> 07:02.480\n Because that's always been the biggest thing for me is I'm really curious about why people\n\n07:02.480 --> 07:07.000\n do what they do, like deeply, deeply curious about it.\n\n07:07.000 --> 07:12.040\n I'm not sure who's more interesting, the people that follow Hitler or Hitler himself.\n\n07:12.040 --> 07:17.440\n So I mean, the question that's coupled with that is, would history roll out in similar\n\n07:17.440 --> 07:20.480\n ways even if there wasn't a Hitler?\n\n07:20.480 --> 07:26.320\n It's the people that created Hitler or did Hitler create the events of World War II?\n\n07:26.320 --> 07:29.640\n I think the people would be more interesting in my opinion.\n\n07:29.640 --> 07:34.520\n That seems to be the, that the charismatic leaders are all out there.\n\n07:34.520 --> 07:38.840\n The failed artists in the case of Hitler, they're all out there and it's just when there's\n\n07:38.840 --> 07:46.080\n this environment of anger and fear, charismatic leaders can take over and it doesn't matter\n\n07:46.080 --> 07:48.520\n if they're evil or good.\n\n07:48.520 --> 07:55.480\n It's like a roll of the dice in terms of history, how evil, how truly insane they are.\n\n07:55.480 --> 08:00.140\n I think Stalin was much more cold in calculating.\n\n08:00.140 --> 08:02.000\n He wasn't as insane as Hitler.\n\n08:02.000 --> 08:08.480\n Hitler was legitimately insane, like especially later on in the war where he would do irrational\n\n08:08.480 --> 08:10.440\n actions I would say.\n\n08:10.440 --> 08:13.640\n But that's like a weird roll of the dice.\n\n08:13.640 --> 08:17.280\n You could have gotten a totally different leader.\n\n08:17.280 --> 08:23.160\n Wanting to take over the entirety of Europe and then invading Russia, that's like insanity.\n\n08:23.160 --> 08:28.640\n Yeah, just even, just the first part of that wanting to take over Europe, if you really\n\n08:28.640 --> 08:34.720\n think about the scale, if you really sit down and go, this one individual was like, I want\n\n08:34.720 --> 08:35.720\n all of this.\n\n08:35.720 --> 08:39.920\n If you really sat down and you were to sit down and put him in his traits that we know\n\n08:39.920 --> 08:47.880\n of into any sort of document nowadays that deems somebody a psychopath or a narcissist,\n\n08:47.880 --> 08:50.920\n this guy would set it on fire.\n\n08:50.920 --> 08:59.260\n He himself was so, I think so damaged and he reminds me a lot of people now who struggle\n\n08:59.260 --> 09:00.260\n to find their way.\n\n09:00.260 --> 09:06.220\n He reminds me a lot of angry individuals who are told no, either by women or by business\n\n09:06.220 --> 09:10.680\n or by whatever the sector they're in.\n\n09:10.680 --> 09:15.280\n He reminds me very much of that like, what's the word I'm looking for?\n\n09:15.280 --> 09:20.960\n Just that individual who's just like, the world is shit and the world owes me everything.\n\n09:20.960 --> 09:22.360\n It's that mentality.\n\n09:22.360 --> 09:25.640\n He really came from that it seems like.\n\n09:25.640 --> 09:28.360\n And when you foster that too long, you get that.\n\n09:28.360 --> 09:34.760\n There's a book called, what is it, Man From Underground by Dostoevsky, I might be misnaming\n\n09:34.760 --> 09:38.280\n the book, but it's about the bitterness of a man.\n\n09:38.280 --> 09:42.120\n It breeds within his mind and it just grows, that bitterness.\n\n09:42.120 --> 09:48.680\n I mean, we all have that sort of resenting of the world when you're younger, when you\n\n09:48.680 --> 09:50.040\n have a choice.\n\n09:50.040 --> 09:56.960\n When you fail, do you blame the world or do you hold, it's the Jaco thing, do you carry\n\n09:56.960 --> 10:02.480\n the responsibility of that and become a better man or woman because of that?\n\n10:02.480 --> 10:03.480\n That's the decision.\n\n10:03.480 --> 10:09.840\n And in some sense, I mean, unfortunately, see that's because he took responsibility\n\n10:09.840 --> 10:10.840\n and leadership.\n\n10:10.840 --> 10:15.120\n I know you can't say he wasn't a leader.\n\n10:15.120 --> 10:17.400\n So it's not that he's a failure.\n\n10:17.400 --> 10:23.040\n He's not a failure, but you can't say he's powerless, did not take action.\n\n10:23.040 --> 10:29.640\n I think he's just basically a embodiment of the anger and the fear of people at the time.\n\n10:29.640 --> 10:35.080\n But the insanity of, obviously, many of my relatives, not just murdering them, but putting\n\n10:35.080 --> 10:40.560\n them in camps and torturing them, but many of those people, Jewish people, were also\n\n10:40.560 --> 10:42.040\n some of the best scientists.\n\n10:42.040 --> 10:49.640\n The insanity of murdering some of the best Germans, it makes no sense.\n\n10:49.640 --> 10:55.800\n So that's why it's fascinating to kind of look back at that time in history and think,\n\n10:55.800 --> 10:57.800\n are these the same humans?\n\n10:57.800 --> 11:02.040\n And also, are there echoes of that now?\n\n11:02.040 --> 11:04.080\n And is that going to happen again?\n\n11:04.080 --> 11:08.880\n Is there going to be a World War III in some other kind of way?\n\n11:08.880 --> 11:13.880\n Is there going to be some mass scale injustice in some other kind of way, which we're not\n\n11:13.880 --> 11:21.000\n yet, because of our blindness and maybe not learning the lessons of history, will allow\n\n11:21.000 --> 11:23.360\n it to happen again?\n\n11:23.360 --> 11:28.040\n And then obviously, it's a very common thing to whatever political leader you don't like,\n\n11:28.040 --> 11:29.040\n to call them Hitler.\n\n11:29.040 --> 11:30.040\n Of course.\n\n11:30.040 --> 11:36.320\n Which is, that to me, I got to tell you, when somebody calls somebody Hitler, the weight\n\n11:36.320 --> 11:40.320\n behind that has been completely lost in this generation.\n\n11:40.320 --> 11:47.600\n This generation does not understand what that truly means to call someone Hitler or a Nazi.\n\n11:47.600 --> 11:48.600\n Or Stalin.\n\n11:48.600 --> 11:54.800\n To be honest, the starvation, I've just been talking to a lot of folks recently, especially\n\n11:54.800 --> 11:58.120\n like North Korea, with Wyoming Park, starvation.\n\n11:58.120 --> 12:06.000\n And I remember from my grandmother, it wasn't, time and time again, not having food to eat\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:10.120\n is the thing that people say is the worst, everything.\n\n12:10.120 --> 12:16.280\n It's way worse than murder, not having food, and the places that takes your mind and the\n\n12:16.280 --> 12:19.840\n actions that forces you to do, that's terrifying.\n\n12:19.840 --> 12:22.520\n And all of that seems very distant in our history.\n\n12:22.520 --> 12:23.920\n Yeah, I love her.\n\n12:23.920 --> 12:26.040\n I watched that interview with her.\n\n12:26.040 --> 12:29.820\n She is, I want to talk to that woman so bad, because when she was on Joe and she sat there\n\n12:29.820 --> 12:33.300\n and said, Joe's like, do you, have you done any therapy?\n\n12:33.300 --> 12:34.300\n And she laughed.\n\n12:34.300 --> 12:36.440\n I was like, oh, that's my girl.\n\n12:36.440 --> 12:39.820\n It's such a fascinating, I mean, I would love for you to kind of talk to her and explore\n\n12:39.820 --> 12:46.080\n her mind, because we kind of explored her story and that's, there's power and importance\n\n12:46.080 --> 12:56.320\n to her story, but it's so difficult to understand, like, how does she become healthier and better?\n\n12:56.320 --> 13:01.480\n Even more so than she's already, she's, she's recovered quite a bit, you know, she's found\n\n13:01.480 --> 13:05.600\n herself quite a bit, but I wonder, is she haunted?\n\n13:05.600 --> 13:07.040\n You're saying questions I want to ask.\n\n13:07.040 --> 13:13.320\n Like, that's what I mean, because after being in a war, there are certain things, there\n\n13:13.320 --> 13:18.460\n are certain atrocities that you see that, it doesn't matter the therapy that you do.\n\n13:18.460 --> 13:21.400\n And I don't care what all the special ops guys say, like, I know plenty of them that\n\n13:21.400 --> 13:24.600\n have a light switch and they turn it off and they can function, but I also know them when\n\n13:24.600 --> 13:26.660\n they've been out for 10 years.\n\n13:26.660 --> 13:31.740\n There's things that haunt people differently, but there's no way, there's not something\n\n13:31.740 --> 13:33.680\n going on there deeply.\n\n13:33.680 --> 13:43.320\n Yeah, but there's also extra levels of complexity in her case because, I mean, this is what,\n\n13:43.320 --> 13:52.520\n just looking at history about family, is she spent much of her early life loving the dictator,\n\n13:52.520 --> 13:53.520\n right?\n\n13:53.520 --> 13:54.520\n Yeah.\n\n13:54.520 --> 13:55.520\n We like the water or something.\n\n13:55.520 --> 13:56.520\n Yeah.\n\n13:56.520 --> 13:59.760\n We like water or we like this because there is no, like, individual, like, when they said\n\n13:59.760 --> 14:01.960\n there was no love or anything.\n\n14:01.960 --> 14:03.760\n But there is a love for the...\n\n14:03.760 --> 14:04.760\n Just that individual.\n\n14:04.760 --> 14:05.760\n For that individual.\n\n14:05.760 --> 14:09.720\n And so, I mean, it's like the ultimate abusive relationship.\n\n14:09.720 --> 14:12.120\n Oh, yeah.\n\n14:12.120 --> 14:15.320\n But it's still love, like you don't know the alternative.\n\n14:15.320 --> 14:22.720\n So it's not even, it's complicated because, like, I wonder if she truly explored it what\n\n14:22.720 --> 14:28.760\n you would find because the trauma, much of her trauma, I think comes from when she was\n\n14:28.760 --> 14:34.040\n escaping North Korea, treatment by China.\n\n14:34.040 --> 14:35.040\n It's like the...\n\n14:35.040 --> 14:39.880\n And her mom and what she had to witness within that and being helpless with that on her own.\n\n14:39.880 --> 14:45.800\n So it's like evil men essentially abusing her, trading her, you know, and doing so nonchalantly,\n\n14:45.800 --> 14:52.000\n like it's part of just the way of life that I wonder if she sees kind of, yeah, it's so\n\n14:52.000 --> 14:54.480\n complicated because childhood...\n\n14:54.480 --> 14:57.200\n It would be normal to her because she didn't know any different.\n\n14:57.200 --> 14:58.200\n Exactly.\n\n14:58.200 --> 14:59.200\n Like there's...\n\n14:59.200 --> 15:04.200\n Like I grew up poor, but I never sensed that.\n\n15:04.200 --> 15:05.880\n Because your parents didn't make you.\n\n15:05.880 --> 15:08.040\n Well, and everyone else around was too.\n\n15:08.040 --> 15:09.040\n Right.\n\n15:09.040 --> 15:10.040\n And so you don't notice it.\n\n15:10.040 --> 15:11.680\n I mean, it's a cultural thing.\n\n15:11.680 --> 15:16.480\n So the way you grow up, you only start to notice it when you compare yourself to others,\n\n15:16.480 --> 15:18.320\n when you learn of the alternative.\n\n15:18.320 --> 15:20.560\n That's the dark reality when you're abused.\n\n15:20.560 --> 15:30.120\n You truly begin to suffer in some kind of way when you understand that you were being\n\n15:30.120 --> 15:32.520\n abused.\n\n15:32.520 --> 15:38.720\n That's a dark kind of thought that I wonder if you live your whole life just in that abuse,\n\n15:38.720 --> 15:41.600\n if you don't know better, that that's a safer...\n\n15:41.600 --> 15:48.000\n That's like, what's a better life, suffering and then learning that you were suffering\n\n15:48.000 --> 15:51.040\n or just suffering until your last days.\n\n15:51.040 --> 15:52.840\n There's two ways to look at this.\n\n15:52.840 --> 15:58.640\n I'd argue on one side that suffering and suffering until you die, you know no different.\n\n15:58.640 --> 16:00.040\n So you can't have hope.\n\n16:00.040 --> 16:03.520\n You can't have this idea that there's better.\n\n16:03.520 --> 16:05.920\n And sometimes that's...\n\n16:05.920 --> 16:06.920\n Keep that in its box.\n\n16:06.920 --> 16:11.920\n But then if you have kind of what you have with Park where she knows now that there's\n\n16:11.920 --> 16:15.560\n different, she knows that there's better, then you run into those.\n\n16:15.560 --> 16:17.340\n What is the damage that has been done?\n\n16:17.340 --> 16:19.600\n What is going to be passed on as intergenerational trauma?\n\n16:19.600 --> 16:21.000\n I know she's a mom.\n\n16:21.000 --> 16:25.120\n So it's like, now you got to look long term a little bit because now she's an influence\n\n16:25.120 --> 16:26.200\n on a child.\n\n16:26.200 --> 16:32.640\n And there's a positive to looking at both, I would say.\n\n16:32.640 --> 16:36.540\n And I know that sounds horrible for the living in trauma your whole life and just not knowing\n\n16:36.540 --> 16:37.960\n any better.\n\n16:37.960 --> 16:38.960\n But there's...\n\n16:38.960 --> 16:47.260\n I don't know if that saves the brain and the body and just that overall or if it actually\n\n16:47.260 --> 16:50.000\n would be better because there's no way to really find that out.\n\n16:50.000 --> 16:51.000\n I don't think.\n\n16:51.000 --> 16:52.000\n Yeah, I think.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:57.160\n But the reality is when you give people hope and you make them realize that they're suffering,\n\n16:57.160 --> 16:58.680\n you're putting a burden on them.\n\n16:58.680 --> 17:00.880\n That's the first step on a long journey.\n\n17:00.880 --> 17:05.440\n And so, and obviously now that she knows that the suffering she wants to make people in\n\n17:05.440 --> 17:08.720\n North Korea currently suffer less.\n\n17:08.720 --> 17:10.680\n And that's an admirable goal.\n\n17:10.680 --> 17:16.560\n It's what we do to each other is try to like, when you see suffering in the world, you try\n\n17:16.560 --> 17:23.920\n to make it better and unmask that's probably in a long arc of history going to make for\n\n17:23.920 --> 17:25.080\n a better world.\n\n17:25.080 --> 17:28.460\n I'm hopeful at that idea for North Korea.\n\n17:28.460 --> 17:35.320\n I'm hopeful for that because you never want to leave individuals suffering when you know\n\n17:35.320 --> 17:38.280\n that they're actively suffering while you're just living your day to day life in the Western\n\n17:38.280 --> 17:42.120\n world just out grocery shopping and you see all this food and you know in the back of\n\n17:42.120 --> 17:43.120\n your mind...\n\n17:43.120 --> 17:45.120\n Like that interview fucked me up a little bit, I won't lie.\n\n17:45.120 --> 17:48.880\n And I had some of the girls in my office listen to it, they're just bawling.\n\n17:48.880 --> 17:56.640\n Because we're all parents and there's this idea that not being able to feed our children,\n\n17:56.640 --> 17:59.100\n just the idea of that damages the psyche.\n\n17:59.100 --> 18:03.240\n It brings up the pain in the chest, just the idea of it.\n\n18:03.240 --> 18:07.120\n And so going to the grocery store for about a week after that, I just remember standing\n\n18:07.120 --> 18:11.060\n there looking and just going, fuck are we doing?\n\n18:11.060 --> 18:17.200\n But then there's that snap reality that comes into play and goes, so how do we fix that?\n\n18:17.200 --> 18:21.960\n You got to take on China, that's never going to happen.\n\n18:21.960 --> 18:24.520\n And the reason that's not going to happen, it's happening again.\n\n18:24.520 --> 18:29.280\n So Akhani comes down through Afghanistan, Chinese are all through Afghanistan, Iran\n\n18:29.280 --> 18:34.560\n makes the deal with China for the roadway to get the oil, well that's done in the blink\n\n18:34.560 --> 18:36.560\n of an eye without anyone knowing.\n\n18:36.560 --> 18:37.960\n There's no way.\n\n18:37.960 --> 18:44.000\n There's just so much at play with China, they control such a large aspect of our world,\n\n18:44.000 --> 18:50.840\n unfortunately that to take and free North Korea, a drastic action would have to happen.\n\n18:50.840 --> 18:54.240\n And then your people would come in, it would be a mess.\n\n18:54.240 --> 18:55.520\n What do you mean your people?\n\n18:55.520 --> 18:57.000\n What do you mean your people?\n\n18:57.000 --> 18:58.760\n Your Russians.\n\n18:58.760 --> 19:00.600\n Did you hear what she said about Russians?\n\n19:00.600 --> 19:01.600\n Did you hear what she says?\n\n19:01.600 --> 19:02.600\n Russians?\n\n19:02.600 --> 19:03.600\n I love Russians.\n\n19:03.600 --> 19:04.600\n You know what I didn't love?\n\n19:04.600 --> 19:07.760\n The Russian recruiting video that came out, that shit was terrifying.\n\n19:07.760 --> 19:08.760\n Did you watch it?\n\n19:08.760 --> 19:09.760\n No.\n\n19:09.760 --> 19:10.760\n I told you about it and of course you didn't watch it.\n\n19:10.760 --> 19:12.920\n I didn't watch it, I'm sorry.\n\n19:12.920 --> 19:20.120\n The USA put out a recruiting video and then like a day or two later Russia put one out.\n\n19:20.120 --> 19:27.260\n And the recruiting video in the States was an animation of a female soldier with two\n\n19:27.260 --> 19:31.920\n moms and she was going to go change the world, right?\n\n19:31.920 --> 19:35.160\n Russia came out with one.\n\n19:35.160 --> 19:40.600\n It's like, it's the character from like Rocky essentially and they're guys in the mud and\n\n19:40.600 --> 19:43.800\n just in the rain just fucking doing pushups, just pushing it out.\n\n19:43.800 --> 19:47.600\n They're just like, they see their boot, they're just like crushing things and I'm like, and\n\n19:47.600 --> 19:51.800\n it's all like, and the deep Russian voice, I'm like, oh my God.\n\n19:51.800 --> 19:53.360\n Which one is better would you say?\n\n19:53.360 --> 19:54.360\n Which bothered you more?\n\n19:54.360 --> 19:58.960\n What do you mean by bother, specify.\n\n19:58.960 --> 20:02.640\n So deception is a funny thing because when you're young and you're choosing to go to\n\n20:02.640 --> 20:07.640\n the military or not, it's not like you know, like none of us know what the best trajectory\n\n20:07.640 --> 20:08.960\n for a life is.\n\n20:08.960 --> 20:13.520\n For many people going to the military is a really, makes them incredible human beings.\n\n20:13.520 --> 20:16.360\n Some of the best people in this world I know are soldiers.\n\n20:16.360 --> 20:20.320\n So it's, I'm not, I don't mean like it's somehow bad to go to the military.\n\n20:20.320 --> 20:25.800\n I think it's a great choice, but there is something, the honest truth is I just don't\n\n20:25.800 --> 20:28.560\n like marketing people.\n\n20:28.560 --> 20:30.560\n And so this is essentially a marketing effort.\n\n20:30.560 --> 20:31.920\n Yeah, it is a marketing effort.\n\n20:31.920 --> 20:34.880\n So which one do you like as a marketing effort better?\n\n20:34.880 --> 20:35.880\n Russia.\n\n20:35.880 --> 20:36.880\n Oh, yeah, I do.\n\n20:36.880 --> 20:37.880\n There you go.\n\n20:37.880 --> 20:38.880\n I do.\n\n20:38.880 --> 20:41.520\n Cause Canada doesn't, you know what our recruiting videos are?\n\n20:41.520 --> 20:44.200\n It's like, I love it.\n\n20:44.200 --> 20:45.200\n They're the best.\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:46.200\n Sorry, eh?\n\n20:46.200 --> 20:47.200\n Yeah.\n\n20:47.200 --> 20:48.200\n Oh, fuck.\n\n20:48.200 --> 20:49.200\n Here we go.\n\n20:49.200 --> 20:50.200\n It's starting.\n\n20:50.200 --> 20:51.200\n It started.\n\n20:51.200 --> 20:52.200\n Awesome.\n\n20:52.200 --> 20:55.760\n So Canada does these ones where it's like, it'll have a bunch of like soldiers doing\n\n20:55.760 --> 20:58.240\n movements and then they'll like snip it together really quick.\n\n20:58.240 --> 21:02.840\n It'll be like a Navy one and a guy jumping out of a plane and then it'll be like an artillery\n\n21:02.840 --> 21:07.600\n and then like an armored and it'd be like, join the Canadian forces today.\n\n21:07.600 --> 21:10.300\n And like, that's like their, their videos.\n\n21:10.300 --> 21:16.000\n So it's like very marketable, very palatable to Canadians who don't really want war and\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:20.000\n who don't really acknowledge their military in the first place and do everything they\n\n21:20.000 --> 21:24.160\n can to make sure that vets don't get any support when they come home.\n\n21:24.160 --> 21:27.640\n So they, I can see why that one is acceptable.\n\n21:27.640 --> 21:33.000\n What Russia did was meant to be more of an intimidation tactic in my opinion.\n\n21:33.000 --> 21:35.080\n I like that style better though.\n\n21:35.080 --> 21:38.600\n I think we need harder, I think we need people to be harder.\n\n21:38.600 --> 21:43.520\n I think it's acceptable and okay to say that our soldiers need to have a harder mindset,\n\n21:43.520 --> 21:48.120\n a stronger mindset, a better mentality and mental health support going into the service\n\n21:48.120 --> 21:54.200\n and a harder body because I know when you go to the US, I've also encountered plenty\n\n21:54.200 --> 21:57.000\n of soldiers that are 600 pounds.\n\n21:57.000 --> 21:59.340\n What are you going to do?\n\n21:59.340 --> 22:03.200\n So we should say that you, when you joined the military, you were in incredible shape\n\n22:03.200 --> 22:05.760\n or not maybe incredible, but very good shape.\n\n22:05.760 --> 22:06.760\n No, I was in incredible shape.\n\n22:06.760 --> 22:07.760\n It was the best shape of my life.\n\n22:07.760 --> 22:08.760\n Yeah.\n\n22:08.760 --> 22:09.760\n Yeah.\n\n22:09.760 --> 22:10.760\n So.\n\n22:10.760 --> 22:11.760\n I'm okay with that.\n\n22:11.760 --> 22:12.760\n It's okay.\n\n22:12.760 --> 22:13.760\n I, you know what?\n\n22:13.760 --> 22:14.760\n I used to do sit ups.\n\n22:14.760 --> 22:18.080\n Like no, I would do sit ups in the morning when I was little until I could see my six.\n\n22:18.080 --> 22:21.520\n Like I always had a six pack because all I did was train.\n\n22:21.520 --> 22:26.120\n But like if I couldn't like see it, I would just sit there in morning cartoons and just\n\n22:26.120 --> 22:27.120\n do sit ups.\n\n22:27.120 --> 22:30.180\n And my mom and dad thought that was like normal acceptable behavior.\n\n22:30.180 --> 22:33.600\n So if you had like Instagram back then, you'd be a David Goggins, you would be just like\n\n22:33.600 --> 22:34.600\n screaming.\n\n22:34.600 --> 22:35.600\n Without the cursing.\n\n22:35.600 --> 22:37.080\n That cursing started once the military started.\n\n22:37.080 --> 22:38.080\n Okay.\n\n22:38.080 --> 22:39.080\n Got it.\n\n22:39.080 --> 22:43.160\n So I mean, the people should know, is it probably already know that you also competed in Taekwondo,\n\n22:43.160 --> 22:45.280\n like you were an athlete of all kinds.\n\n22:45.280 --> 22:47.600\n They even saw rugby in there.\n\n22:47.600 --> 22:48.600\n Yeah.\n\n22:48.600 --> 22:50.280\n I was, I was, I was good at rugby.\n\n22:50.280 --> 22:55.920\n I played that for seven, six years, I guess you could say total.\n\n22:55.920 --> 23:00.840\n I think the worst injury I ever ended up having was I tore my right eyelid off.\n\n23:00.840 --> 23:02.660\n We were doing an exhibition game.\n\n23:02.660 --> 23:04.160\n I don't do exhibition games well.\n\n23:04.160 --> 23:06.120\n I don't do like for fun well.\n\n23:06.120 --> 23:07.120\n I don't do like.\n\n23:07.120 --> 23:08.120\n So you're very competitive.\n\n23:08.120 --> 23:09.880\n No, not me.\n\n23:09.880 --> 23:10.880\n So you're being funny.\n\n23:10.880 --> 23:11.880\n Ah, there it is.\n\n23:11.880 --> 23:12.880\n He gets it.\n\n23:12.880 --> 23:15.480\n You see, he's not, he's not a robot.\n\n23:15.480 --> 23:23.940\n What I was saying though to you was that we did an exhibition game and the team ahead\n\n23:23.940 --> 23:24.940\n was winning.\n\n23:24.940 --> 23:28.400\n The team we were playing was winning, which was annoying.\n\n23:28.400 --> 23:33.680\n And so there was an opportunity to take out a girl that was going one end of the field\n\n23:33.680 --> 23:36.840\n to the other and she just kept hitting tries left, right and center.\n\n23:36.840 --> 23:37.960\n She was fast.\n\n23:37.960 --> 23:42.740\n So I figured if I just aimed her up, like she's a target and I just run full force at\n\n23:42.740 --> 23:47.360\n her because she was really, she was a tall individual, but I just, if I do that, I'll\n\n23:47.360 --> 23:48.360\n take her out of the knees.\n\n23:48.360 --> 23:50.800\n So I did that.\n\n23:50.800 --> 23:53.940\n But that, what that resulted in was she put her tooth through her mouth guard and knocked\n\n23:53.940 --> 23:55.480\n out and didn't just, she just stayed there.\n\n23:55.480 --> 24:00.440\n But when I stood up, I tore the right eyelid off and it was hanging from the inner corner.\n\n24:00.440 --> 24:01.440\n Yeah.\n\n24:01.440 --> 24:07.800\n My mom was there cause mom was my mom's, my biggest fan and she's supportive of everything\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:08.800\n and she didn't miss a game.\n\n24:08.800 --> 24:10.900\n She didn't miss an anything.\n\n24:10.900 --> 24:14.760\n And um, I stood up and I kind of turned around and we already had a girl break her nose that\n\n24:14.760 --> 24:15.760\n day.\n\n24:15.760 --> 24:19.020\n So she was on the sideline with her nose sideways and just bloody.\n\n24:19.020 --> 24:22.760\n My mom was like, I'll take her to the emergency after once the game's over.\n\n24:22.760 --> 24:26.680\n And so I turned around and looked at her and she just, she almost vomited on the spot and\n\n24:26.680 --> 24:27.680\n I was like, what's wrong?\n\n24:27.680 --> 24:29.960\n She's like, don't move your eyelids off.\n\n24:29.960 --> 24:34.120\n I'm like, but I can see like I was trying to blink, but like it was just down so I could\n\n24:34.120 --> 24:36.080\n just constantly see.\n\n24:36.080 --> 24:37.880\n She's like, we're just, we're just going to go to the emergency.\n\n24:37.880 --> 24:39.640\n We're just going to go there now.\n\n24:39.640 --> 24:40.640\n Was there blood?\n\n24:40.640 --> 24:41.640\n Yeah.\n\n24:41.640 --> 24:43.360\n There's lots of it, but I couldn't really tell.\n\n24:43.360 --> 24:44.360\n Okay.\n\n24:44.360 --> 24:46.360\n Were you okay with blood at that point?\n\n24:46.360 --> 24:47.360\n Yeah.\n\n24:47.360 --> 24:48.360\n Yeah.\n\n24:48.360 --> 24:49.360\n I mean, I guess you did taekwondo and all that.\n\n24:49.360 --> 24:50.360\n Yeah.\n\n24:50.360 --> 24:51.360\n I didn't get knocked out very often.\n\n24:51.360 --> 24:53.720\n Like when I was younger in taekwondo, I was really good.\n\n24:53.720 --> 24:56.400\n I only lost a handful of times.\n\n24:56.400 --> 24:59.080\n So when I did lose, that was bad.\n\n24:59.080 --> 25:04.400\n But I never had like a broken nose or a lot of blood on my face, like nothing like that\n\n25:04.400 --> 25:05.400\n really.\n\n25:05.400 --> 25:07.920\n So nothing freaked me out too much.\n\n25:07.920 --> 25:12.360\n Was there aggression there or just purely competition over skill?\n\n25:12.360 --> 25:14.000\n A mix of both.\n\n25:14.000 --> 25:19.960\n I was, this was right after, not too long after my coach went to prison for statutory\n\n25:19.960 --> 25:27.800\n rape and that was like how you talk about Park talking about how that was like she knew\n\n25:27.800 --> 25:31.040\n love because of that person.\n\n25:31.040 --> 25:33.460\n That person was like a God to me.\n\n25:33.460 --> 25:36.240\n And so when that happened, I was just an angry individual from that point on.\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:38.680\n So there was competition and aggression mixed in there.\n\n25:38.680 --> 25:44.200\n Oh, like it was betrayal that there's just somebody that is, was a symbol of love for\n\n25:44.200 --> 25:46.640\n you, could also be a very bad person.\n\n25:46.640 --> 25:52.000\n I used to eat, sleep, and breathe whatever that man said from four years old on.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:56.440\n I lived with my coaches at a point so I could train that much.\n\n25:56.440 --> 25:58.140\n I helped look after their daughter.\n\n25:58.140 --> 26:00.240\n I was at the club 24 seven.\n\n26:00.240 --> 26:05.880\n It just the idea that somebody could do something like that, yeah, that really messed me up.\n\n26:05.880 --> 26:10.200\n Where were you on 9 11?\n\n26:10.200 --> 26:15.700\n I was 11 and I was in my parents basement.\n\n26:15.700 --> 26:16.700\n In where?\n\n26:16.700 --> 26:17.700\n Ontario.\n\n26:17.700 --> 26:18.700\n Ontario, Canada.\n\n26:18.700 --> 26:26.720\n What did you think of 9 11 at that age from Canada that have an impact on you in terms\n\n26:26.720 --> 26:35.680\n of changing the level of evil you thought is there in the world today?\n\n26:35.680 --> 26:36.680\n Not initially.\n\n26:36.680 --> 26:38.400\n I remember it really vividly.\n\n26:38.400 --> 26:41.480\n I have a decent memory for certain things.\n\n26:41.480 --> 26:44.800\n It seems like stuff like that I stick with really well.\n\n26:44.800 --> 26:45.800\n I remember watching it.\n\n26:45.800 --> 26:51.440\n I was sitting on the couch and my mom called my dad because my parents are truck drivers.\n\n26:51.440 --> 26:56.160\n My dad was on the road, if I'm not mistaken, and he would go in and out of cities all the\n\n26:56.160 --> 26:57.160\n time.\n\n26:57.160 --> 26:58.160\n I think he was on the East Coast.\n\n26:58.160 --> 27:00.040\n My mom was a little panicky.\n\n27:00.040 --> 27:01.480\n She tried to get a hold of him.\n\n27:01.480 --> 27:07.600\n I think at the time it was beepers and yeah, so he would get a beep, he would go to a payphone\n\n27:07.600 --> 27:08.600\n and call us.\n\n27:08.600 --> 27:10.120\n He was fine.\n\n27:10.120 --> 27:16.400\n I remember my mom being really upset and I couldn't quite grasp why she was so upset.\n\n27:16.400 --> 27:18.640\n I knew something really bad had happened.\n\n27:18.640 --> 27:24.360\n It's when I then saw the second plane go into the tower and I remember her just like the\n\n27:24.360 --> 27:29.480\n stereotypical like hand over her mouth and she just felt sick and she just was so confused\n\n27:29.480 --> 27:33.640\n and I knew it was bad, but I didn't fully grasp it.\n\n27:33.640 --> 27:36.720\n We went to school that day and they had talked about it briefly.\n\n27:36.720 --> 27:39.380\n You could hear the teachers kind of reminiscing about it.\n\n27:39.380 --> 27:47.560\n There was a point that week that all of a sudden all of the children who were from a\n\n27:47.560 --> 27:50.720\n Middle Eastern family were not at school.\n\n27:50.720 --> 27:55.440\n I just remember them saying like a lot of people aren't coming to school, but it was\n\n27:55.440 --> 27:56.440\n in particular.\n\n27:56.440 --> 28:02.360\n I think parents were afraid once it got out that it was of a certain group.\n\n28:02.360 --> 28:06.400\n They were afraid for their own kids and fair enough, I mean, you never know.\n\n28:06.400 --> 28:11.280\n You don't know and I knew it impacted me enough that I did write.\n\n28:11.280 --> 28:16.280\n I remember the school was doing a memorial for it and I remember they asked, I wrote\n\n28:16.280 --> 28:21.400\n a poem and a reporter was there and I read it on air.\n\n28:21.400 --> 28:28.400\n I remember it was a very short one, but I remember I wanted to do something, but I didn't\n\n28:28.400 --> 28:30.720\n know why or for what reason.\n\n28:30.720 --> 28:34.720\n I knew I wanted to do something to honor it, but I couldn't grasp why.\n\n28:34.720 --> 28:38.280\n You eventually went to Afghanistan.\n\n28:38.280 --> 28:43.920\n Did that begin to plant the seed of thinking about conflict in the world?\n\n28:43.920 --> 28:45.200\n It's a good question.\n\n28:45.200 --> 28:47.120\n I never thought about it that in depth.\n\n28:47.120 --> 28:48.680\n I mean, I've done 12 years of therapy.\n\n28:48.680 --> 28:52.360\n You think that would have come up, Dr. Passi, but apparently not.\n\n28:52.360 --> 28:53.360\n We'll work on it though.\n\n28:53.360 --> 28:58.920\n I mean, when did the idea of war start entering your mind?\n\n28:58.920 --> 29:02.440\n Late high school, I think it was for me.\n\n29:02.440 --> 29:04.380\n I finished high school at 17.\n\n29:04.380 --> 29:08.840\n I moved away and went to college, I went to Algonquin College because I wasn't smart enough\n\n29:08.840 --> 29:13.800\n to get into Ottawa U. I was like, well, Algonquin, cheers.\n\n29:13.800 --> 29:17.840\n I just wanted to play sports and frankly, I wanted away from my small town that I was\n\n29:17.840 --> 29:18.840\n living in.\n\n29:18.840 --> 29:22.320\n I went through a bad high school breakup as a kid and you know that where you think that's\n\n29:22.320 --> 29:27.320\n like the love of your life and you just can't bear to be anywhere near anybody.\n\n29:27.320 --> 29:31.520\n I moved away as fast as I possibly could.\n\n29:31.520 --> 29:36.640\n I didn't grasp it still at that point.\n\n29:36.640 --> 29:38.840\n Love and heartbreak.\n\n29:38.840 --> 29:40.480\n Okay.\n\n29:40.480 --> 29:42.640\n Why did you become a soldier?\n\n29:42.640 --> 29:45.280\n Why did you want to become a soldier?\n\n29:45.280 --> 29:48.760\n My parents told me from an early age, they always figured I would either be a cop.\n\n29:48.760 --> 29:54.160\n I would do, they didn't think military, but they thought it would be like a type A personality,\n\n29:54.160 --> 29:59.400\n possibly carry a gun situation and I'd never hunted before.\n\n29:59.400 --> 30:00.520\n We never had guns in our house.\n\n30:00.520 --> 30:03.920\n I was never exposed to weapons of any kind.\n\n30:03.920 --> 30:07.000\n If anything, it was the opposite.\n\n30:07.000 --> 30:10.680\n All the hunters on the property, like all the deer would come to our property and all\n\n30:10.680 --> 30:14.080\n the hunters would be, no, I'm not, my mom would put salt licks out so that they wouldn't\n\n30:14.080 --> 30:15.080\n get killed.\n\n30:15.080 --> 30:16.640\n Your property was the safe space for the deer.\n\n30:16.640 --> 30:17.640\n Yeah.\n\n30:17.640 --> 30:22.160\n It was 17 acres of forest and they just, we had two turkeys that used to walk up and down\n\n30:22.160 --> 30:23.440\n the driveway every day.\n\n30:23.440 --> 30:26.280\n We had bears in there and nobody bothered them.\n\n30:26.280 --> 30:31.000\n And so there was no aspect of like, I want to go kill shit, that was not like a thing.\n\n30:31.000 --> 30:35.800\n I had no idea I wanted to take anybody off the face of the earth or any thing.\n\n30:35.800 --> 30:43.400\n I went to school and because I'm a history person, my parents has always made it really\n\n30:43.400 --> 30:46.360\n important that Remembrance Day is the thing in our life.\n\n30:46.360 --> 30:47.480\n So that's Veterans Day for you.\n\n30:47.480 --> 30:51.720\n So it's November 11th and it's, you go, you honor.\n\n30:51.720 --> 30:55.920\n I don't care if you don't want to go, I don't care if it's raining, you go.\n\n30:55.920 --> 31:01.480\n And so I went to the Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa that year, which was, it's our capital,\n\n31:01.480 --> 31:04.800\n which is, yeah, it's our capital and it's really small.\n\n31:04.800 --> 31:10.360\n And so I went, but I took the bus and I was on the bus back to Algonquin.\n\n31:10.360 --> 31:16.800\n And I met a lady who was like a World War II vet, really old lady, she had an Air Force\n\n31:16.800 --> 31:19.120\n uniform on and just like this row of medals.\n\n31:19.120 --> 31:25.560\n And I mean, I think you can tell by our limited to extreme interactions we've had over the\n\n31:25.560 --> 31:29.160\n short period of time, I'm curious and I'll just ask you.\n\n31:29.160 --> 31:32.480\n And so I just got up and talked to her and just started talking to her.\n\n31:32.480 --> 31:37.600\n And she didn't say like, I don't remember exactly her words, but she served, she was\n\n31:37.600 --> 31:44.320\n one of the first females to fly and all of these kinds of things that stuck in my head.\n\n31:44.320 --> 31:47.360\n And we just kind of kept talking and I missed my stop.\n\n31:47.360 --> 31:51.960\n And then I finished talking to her and I got back on the bus and went back to the college\n\n31:51.960 --> 31:58.400\n and walked into my small apartment where I had two roommates, these two guys I went to\n\n31:58.400 --> 32:01.080\n high school with, one of them I went to high school with, one was from out of town.\n\n32:01.080 --> 32:08.280\n And I just didn't like what I was, I wasn't happy, I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.\n\n32:08.280 --> 32:11.360\n And I didn't know what I wanted to do truthfully.\n\n32:11.360 --> 32:14.600\n Something just said, why don't you join the army?\n\n32:14.600 --> 32:19.080\n Like in myself, my self talk was like, let's just join the military, let's do it.\n\n32:19.080 --> 32:24.640\n Are you in general somebody that just follows the gut, like when your heart tells you something,\n\n32:24.640 --> 32:25.640\n you go with it?\n\n32:25.640 --> 32:31.120\n For the most part, because I figured out, at least now I figured out what parts I could,\n\n32:31.120 --> 32:33.280\n like what feeling I can trust and which one I can't.\n\n32:33.280 --> 32:37.160\n Which one's anxiety versus which one's my actual intuition talking.\n\n32:37.160 --> 32:39.720\n So why did you sign up to be an artillery gunner?\n\n32:39.720 --> 32:42.240\n Because they wouldn't let me be infantry.\n\n32:42.240 --> 32:48.640\n I mean, why would you want to be infantry?\n\n32:48.640 --> 32:52.440\n I mean, you're naming a lot of dangerous activities.\n\n32:52.440 --> 32:56.480\n Yeah, but that wasn't a thought in my mind at the time.\n\n32:56.480 --> 32:59.760\n My idea was if I was going to do this and I was going to put myself through the bullshit\n\n32:59.760 --> 33:04.480\n and the training and all of the hell and the pushups and the screaming dad, I wanted to\n\n33:04.480 --> 33:07.060\n do something that I know was actually going to be affecting something.\n\n33:07.060 --> 33:11.320\n And what I knew was making change or affecting or on the front lines was infantry, artillery\n\n33:11.320 --> 33:12.320\n or armored.\n\n33:12.320 --> 33:14.040\n So I was like, one of those.\n\n33:14.040 --> 33:16.920\n Can you explain the difference, infantry, artillery and armored?\n\n33:16.920 --> 33:20.800\n Do you want like the layman's term or do you want me to actually explain, explain?\n\n33:20.800 --> 33:24.440\n Well, listening to your conversation with Jaco, especially, I love how you get into\n\n33:24.440 --> 33:25.440\n details.\n\n33:25.440 --> 33:26.440\n Okay, so let's detail this then.\n\n33:26.440 --> 33:27.440\n Okay.\n\n33:27.440 --> 33:34.240\n So infantry is your frontline door kicking, you know, blasting the door open, running\n\n33:34.240 --> 33:36.640\n and get the fuck on the ground, just that, that, that, that, that.\n\n33:36.640 --> 33:39.840\n They're the guys that, you know, double tap you in the face and they show up in the middle\n\n33:39.840 --> 33:41.800\n of the night and put a barrel in your head.\n\n33:41.800 --> 33:46.480\n Like those are the guys that are sleeping in the trenches, that are eating MREs, who\n\n33:46.480 --> 33:51.360\n are being shot at, who are being blown up, who are doing the dirty work and not sleeping\n\n33:51.360 --> 33:55.840\n and carrying the a hundred pound pack and, and are side by side with your buddies in\n\n33:55.840 --> 33:56.840\n the trenches.\n\n33:56.840 --> 33:57.840\n I wanted that.\n\n33:57.840 --> 33:58.840\n That.\n\n33:58.840 --> 34:01.520\n They said it was too small for that.\n\n34:01.520 --> 34:02.520\n So then...\n\n34:02.520 --> 34:05.720\n You were, sorry to interrupt, you were too small under a hundred pounds?\n\n34:05.720 --> 34:10.800\n At the time I was about 103 and I'm, I'm five foot, like on a, if you roll my back out,\n\n34:10.800 --> 34:14.640\n like I really try, I'm five foot.\n\n34:14.640 --> 34:19.880\n At the time though, I think my, my license said 411, so.\n\n34:19.880 --> 34:23.040\n So you were too small for infantry.\n\n34:23.040 --> 34:24.040\n Yeah.\n\n34:24.040 --> 34:28.400\n They just, like, there was no mandate at which they said you can't be, but they said, you\n\n34:28.400 --> 34:31.120\n know, we don't want to put you through training that you're going to fail out of and then\n\n34:31.120 --> 34:33.560\n have to recourse you and then find a new job for you.\n\n34:33.560 --> 34:36.800\n And they want to try to, this is what you're going in for.\n\n34:36.800 --> 34:39.560\n They want to have you follow through that path.\n\n34:39.560 --> 34:42.840\n So then there was armored, which are your tanks.\n\n34:42.840 --> 34:48.120\n So that's your movie like Fury where your tank battles and, which we don't really do\n\n34:48.120 --> 34:51.920\n anymore, but you're rolling around in tanks, you've got guys in the back or you're a driver,\n\n34:51.920 --> 34:57.280\n you're a turret gunner, which I would have enjoyed, but the idea of being in a closed\n\n34:57.280 --> 35:00.420\n metal box, something about it made me panic.\n\n35:00.420 --> 35:03.000\n So I was like, maybe not for me.\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:06.680\n There's of course power to that kind of a big gun.\n\n35:06.680 --> 35:08.760\n Well, that's why I went for the bigger one.\n\n35:08.760 --> 35:09.760\n Okay.\n\n35:09.760 --> 35:12.720\n By the way, think of Russia leads the world in number of tanks.\n\n35:12.720 --> 35:19.480\n We're still, it's very like, what is it, alpha demonstration of like, look, we have largest\n\n35:19.480 --> 35:20.660\n number of tanks.\n\n35:20.660 --> 35:22.120\n You know what takes tanks out though?\n\n35:22.120 --> 35:23.120\n What?\n\n35:23.120 --> 35:25.280\n Some gasoline, some old batteries and a wire.\n\n35:25.280 --> 35:27.520\n Yeah, but tanks still look badass.\n\n35:27.520 --> 35:29.380\n They look great, but they don't last.\n\n35:29.380 --> 35:33.300\n But so much of the military, like we said with the recruiting videos, it's a display\n\n35:33.300 --> 35:37.080\n of power versus the actual implementation of power.\n\n35:37.080 --> 35:38.080\n Fair.\n\n35:38.080 --> 35:39.080\n Okay.\n\n35:39.080 --> 35:40.080\n Artillery.\n\n35:40.080 --> 35:41.080\n So I'm doing my best here.\n\n35:41.080 --> 35:45.360\n I don't know what double tap means, which you said earlier, it means two shots to the\n\n35:45.360 --> 35:46.360\n face.\n\n35:46.360 --> 35:47.360\n Why two?\n\n35:47.360 --> 35:48.360\n To be sure.\n\n35:48.360 --> 35:49.360\n Okay.\n\n35:49.360 --> 35:50.360\n All right.\n\n35:50.360 --> 35:51.360\n You guys, taxpayers pay for the ammo.\n\n35:51.360 --> 35:52.360\n It's fine.\n\n35:52.360 --> 35:54.000\n So, but you don't want to do three because that's wasting the ammo.\n\n35:54.000 --> 35:55.560\n Well, that's now that's a waste.\n\n35:55.560 --> 35:56.560\n Okay.\n\n35:56.560 --> 35:57.560\n Double tap to the face.\n\n35:57.560 --> 36:01.320\n There's so much awesome terminology here or gruesome terminology, depending on your\n\n36:01.320 --> 36:02.320\n perspective.\n\n36:02.320 --> 36:03.320\n Okay.\n\n36:03.320 --> 36:04.320\n So artillery.\n\n36:04.320 --> 36:05.320\n Yeah.\n\n36:05.320 --> 36:06.320\n So that's the hand of God.\n\n36:06.320 --> 36:07.320\n Sorry.\n\n36:07.320 --> 36:16.240\n No, that's intensely a romanticized version, but okay, artillery, the hand of God.\n\n36:16.240 --> 36:19.720\n So it will reach out and touch you from wherever we want.\n\n36:19.720 --> 36:24.800\n It's like F18 pilots or bombers.\n\n36:24.800 --> 36:28.160\n You won't know they're there until they're there.\n\n36:28.160 --> 36:33.720\n And so for artillery, I really honestly didn't think artillery would be a fit for me.\n\n36:33.720 --> 36:35.160\n I didn't know much about it.\n\n36:35.160 --> 36:38.280\n They were just like, these are what you can pick from.\n\n36:38.280 --> 36:40.280\n And I was like, I'll go here.\n\n36:40.280 --> 36:43.780\n So in World War II, they used much closer artillery.\n\n36:43.780 --> 36:50.180\n So we're called the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery because the Queen made us Royal Canadian Artillery.\n\n36:50.180 --> 36:52.400\n And we shoot these rounds.\n\n36:52.400 --> 36:55.080\n When you're in training, you shoot smaller, smaller ammunition.\n\n36:55.080 --> 36:56.520\n They're about 40 pounds.\n\n36:56.520 --> 37:00.720\n They go, I'm going to get this wrong, 20 K, 20 kilometers.\n\n37:00.720 --> 37:04.240\n So whatever that is in your mile things.\n\n37:04.240 --> 37:08.840\n And they have a casing on them and they're much easier.\n\n37:08.840 --> 37:10.340\n They're easier to handle.\n\n37:10.340 --> 37:11.340\n The guns are smaller.\n\n37:11.340 --> 37:12.640\n You need less people for them.\n\n37:12.640 --> 37:14.360\n They're basically what you train on nowadays.\n\n37:14.360 --> 37:16.180\n It's not what we use overseas.\n\n37:16.180 --> 37:19.480\n What we use overseas, now those things are beautiful.\n\n37:19.480 --> 37:25.640\n Those are just a sheer work of the engineering behind them just makes my heart skip a beat.\n\n37:25.640 --> 37:27.360\n Yeah, the engineering on modern guns is amazing.\n\n37:27.360 --> 37:29.000\n So are we talking about machine guns here?\n\n37:29.000 --> 37:30.000\n So fully automatic?\n\n37:30.000 --> 37:31.720\n No, you're talking about an artillery gun.\n\n37:31.720 --> 37:38.600\n So what it is, it's a 155 millimeter howitzer that shoots up to up to 40 kilometers accurately,\n\n37:38.600 --> 37:44.120\n 45 unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound round.\n\n37:44.120 --> 37:47.760\n Oh, okay.\n\n37:47.760 --> 37:50.560\n So that, but there is still precision.\n\n37:50.560 --> 37:51.560\n Accurate as hell.\n\n37:51.560 --> 37:52.560\n Accurate.\n\n37:52.560 --> 37:53.560\n Okay.\n\n37:53.560 --> 37:56.960\n Accurate if the people behind it that are shooting it and aiming it are accurate.\n\n37:56.960 --> 37:58.400\n Okay.\n\n37:58.400 --> 38:01.920\n So how, at which stage of the warfare do they come in?\n\n38:01.920 --> 38:03.240\n Are they saving you?\n\n38:03.240 --> 38:08.680\n Like say a bunch of people get raided, a bunch of the sole infantry get raided and then the\n\n38:08.680 --> 38:13.240\n artillery saves them or are they the first line of attack or what are they, where does\n\n38:13.240 --> 38:14.720\n the artillery go?\n\n38:14.720 --> 38:17.400\n Like the hand of God presumes they're helping.\n\n38:17.400 --> 38:18.400\n Yeah.\n\n38:18.400 --> 38:19.400\n Yeah.\n\n38:19.400 --> 38:20.400\n That's, well, that's it.\n\n38:20.400 --> 38:25.000\n So depending on the operation or whomever is running it or how they want it done, sometimes\n\n38:25.000 --> 38:29.200\n if they just know there's targets, they'll use us, you know, high value targets.\n\n38:29.200 --> 38:32.720\n So we have this round, it's called the Excalibur round.\n\n38:32.720 --> 38:34.680\n It costs about half a million dollars per round.\n\n38:34.680 --> 38:39.840\n It comes in a special tube that is like sealed and locked and you have to get permission\n\n38:39.840 --> 38:43.440\n from Ottawa to shoot it and it's only used for VIP targets.\n\n38:43.440 --> 38:50.280\n So like we have VIP for everyone and it will, it's GPS guided, it's rocket propelled and\n\n38:50.280 --> 38:57.040\n when you fire it, it will, if this is a wall and somebody's standing on this side of it,\n\n38:57.040 --> 38:58.120\n we'll hit you right there.\n\n38:58.120 --> 39:01.480\n We won't touch that wall, it will hit you pinpoint.\n\n39:01.480 --> 39:06.480\n It'll go right through whatever concrete, whatever and it will destroy.\n\n39:06.480 --> 39:12.520\n So it's basically the same thing as being a sniper, but with a much more damaging weapon.\n\n39:12.520 --> 39:13.880\n We don't use that round often.\n\n39:13.880 --> 39:18.160\n I think it's only been used a handful of times max in Afghanistan that I'm aware of.\n\n39:18.160 --> 39:24.120\n Again, I haven't, I wasn't there from 2009 until 21, but I, I know people that still\n\n39:24.120 --> 39:28.200\n deployed in that, in those units and I don't know that it was used very often, but the\n\n39:28.200 --> 39:33.360\n regular rounds, so there's HE, there's loom, so HE is high explosive, there's loom.\n\n39:33.360 --> 39:39.120\n You shoot that, it explodes in the sky, it lights up the sky for the infantry below and\n\n39:39.120 --> 39:42.580\n then there's shrapnel rounds that will explode in the sky and then shrapnel just rains down\n\n39:42.580 --> 39:43.580\n hell on you.\n\n39:43.580 --> 39:51.040\n HE is what you use normally in my, I'm trying to say this right because I know people squawked\n\n39:51.040 --> 39:53.760\n at me about some of the stuff on Jocko, so I'm trying to be very accurate.\n\n39:53.760 --> 39:58.280\n In my experience, we used HE rounds to wipe people off the face of the earth when the\n\n39:58.280 --> 40:00.080\n infantry needed us.\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:05.760\n So we would get a call at any time and there's always two guns together.\n\n40:05.760 --> 40:08.440\n So you never, you never go solo gun ever.\n\n40:08.440 --> 40:12.600\n If you are, it's, there's, it's sketchy and there's bad shits happening.\n\n40:12.600 --> 40:13.600\n Can you explain that?\n\n40:13.600 --> 40:15.240\n So there's two gun, two people, two guns?\n\n40:15.240 --> 40:17.480\n No, two guns with each gun troop.\n\n40:17.480 --> 40:20.400\n So each gun troop has five to seven people running a gun at all times.\n\n40:20.400 --> 40:21.400\n Oh wow.\n\n40:21.400 --> 40:22.400\n It takes a lot of people to run one of those.\n\n40:22.400 --> 40:24.240\n How much electronics is there?\n\n40:24.240 --> 40:28.360\n The GPS, like the computer system that's on it itself, I never ran that much, but it is\n\n40:28.360 --> 40:32.620\n completely technologically, it's GPS guided.\n\n40:32.620 --> 40:35.400\n All you have to do is literally type in the coordinates.\n\n40:35.400 --> 40:40.220\n Then you've got the two big, um, there's a, there's a technical word, word for it, but\n\n40:40.220 --> 40:44.540\n basically wheels and one does the trajectory, you know, you do your, and you're just kind\n\n40:44.540 --> 40:46.700\n of doing this and you're watching the watch in it.\n\n40:46.700 --> 40:50.160\n And once you hit your target, that's, you know, it'll tell you that's where you need\n\n40:50.160 --> 40:51.160\n to hit.\n\n40:51.160 --> 40:56.040\n Do you know if there's any like AI stuff like computer vision, like where there's cameras\n\n40:56.040 --> 41:03.280\n and they help you target using like all different kinds of cameras to see through like the fog,\n\n41:03.280 --> 41:04.280\n all those kinds of things.\n\n41:04.280 --> 41:10.560\n We use, um, the FOO, which are Forward Observation Officers, which are an artillery individual\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:14.080\n that is embedded with an infantry unit.\n\n41:14.080 --> 41:15.080\n Oh wow.\n\n41:15.080 --> 41:16.080\n Okay.\n\n41:16.080 --> 41:19.000\n They call from the front, give us their grid coordinates and basically say like, don't\n\n41:19.000 --> 41:20.000\n drop this on us.\n\n41:20.000 --> 41:21.000\n Got it.\n\n41:21.000 --> 41:24.080\n So, well, you know what not to shoot, which parts not to shoot.\n\n41:24.080 --> 41:25.080\n Correct.\n\n41:25.080 --> 41:26.080\n And then.\n\n41:26.080 --> 41:27.080\n As long as no one moves.\n\n41:27.080 --> 41:28.080\n Don't move.\n\n41:28.080 --> 41:29.080\n Stay still.\n\n41:29.080 --> 41:32.840\n But you can hear it coming, but you can't hear it until it's too close.\n\n41:32.840 --> 41:35.160\n So like when I went, sorry, go ahead, you were going to say something.\n\n41:35.160 --> 41:39.960\n No, I was going to say, what's the experience on the other, like, what does it feel like\n\n41:39.960 --> 41:44.640\n to be maybe infantry or underneath it, underneath the artillery?\n\n41:44.640 --> 41:52.360\n Well, I, I had the rare opportunity to do that and I have a video I'll show you after.\n\n41:52.360 --> 41:57.460\n It's terrifying because I know the people that are shooting it and I know them personally\n\n41:57.460 --> 42:00.680\n and I know what they're like as humans and for the most part they're dialed.\n\n42:00.680 --> 42:05.240\n Well, you get the odd duck where you're like, I've seen people have an ND, which is a negligent\n\n42:05.240 --> 42:06.720\n discharge.\n\n42:06.720 --> 42:08.000\n You basically get charged for it.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:12.760\n You get in a lot of trouble because you can blow people up and it like accidents happen.\n\n42:12.760 --> 42:15.880\n And so I know accidents can happen in stressful situations.\n\n42:15.880 --> 42:19.960\n And when I was with the Brits, we had to call danger, close artillery.\n\n42:19.960 --> 42:23.640\n And when it goes over top of you, it sounds like thunder and lightning.\n\n42:23.640 --> 42:28.920\n So you fire it and it's not the stereotype that you hear in World War II where it kind\n\n42:28.920 --> 42:34.080\n of like that, it's more of like a crackle.\n\n42:34.080 --> 42:38.960\n And then you just hear like a whiz and it shit just goes everywhere.\n\n42:38.960 --> 42:39.960\n It's loud.\n\n42:39.960 --> 42:41.280\n It shakes the ground.\n\n42:41.280 --> 42:42.280\n It shakes you.\n\n42:42.280 --> 42:44.400\n It, you feel it.\n\n42:44.400 --> 42:46.280\n Okay.\n\n42:46.280 --> 42:50.920\n Is there some more words you can put to like the experience of what it's like to be in\n\n42:50.920 --> 42:53.760\n the heat of, of, of battle there?\n\n42:53.760 --> 42:57.280\n So what is, is there literally, is it hot?\n\n42:57.280 --> 42:58.280\n Is it\n\n42:58.280 --> 42:59.720\n like being under it or shooting it?\n\n42:59.720 --> 43:00.720\n Under it.\n\n43:00.720 --> 43:01.720\n Oh yeah.\n\n43:01.720 --> 43:02.720\n It, 55 degree heat.\n\n43:02.720 --> 43:04.880\n You're, you know that you're waiting for it to be called.\n\n43:04.880 --> 43:10.220\n You feel an overwhelming excitement to start because for me, I'd never been under it.\n\n43:10.220 --> 43:12.760\n So I was like, okay, I had my camera ready.\n\n43:12.760 --> 43:16.760\n Like I was a kid at a candy store and I'm like, I want to watch this happen.\n\n43:16.760 --> 43:21.440\n And once you hear the crackle, I got really fearful.\n\n43:21.440 --> 43:24.760\n My anxiety kicked up significantly.\n\n43:24.760 --> 43:28.900\n I got to the point where I got numb.\n\n43:28.900 --> 43:32.960\n Like I was, my nerves were on overdrive so much that like my body would go like numb.\n\n43:32.960 --> 43:35.600\n Like I couldn't move, but like my nerves were numb.\n\n43:35.600 --> 43:36.600\n If that makes sense.\n\n43:36.600 --> 43:42.400\n What, what were the nerves like and we're talking about fear or is it just anxious excitement?\n\n43:42.400 --> 43:45.840\n Anxious excitement, hopeful that they wouldn't blow it up on us.\n\n43:45.840 --> 43:52.560\n And there was this, there was this excitement that's hard to describe because you don't\n\n43:52.560 --> 43:55.880\n want to be excited that you're dropping bombs on people.\n\n43:55.880 --> 44:00.200\n But when you just saw their faces and they're shooting at you, there's this overwhelming\n\n44:00.200 --> 44:02.920\n feeling of got you motherfucker.\n\n44:02.920 --> 44:03.920\n Yeah.\n\n44:03.920 --> 44:04.920\n Yeah.\n\n44:04.920 --> 44:10.400\n Well, we'll talk about that because that's such a difficult thing about wars.\n\n44:10.400 --> 44:15.680\n You forget that it's other human beings because those other human beings are doing really\n\n44:15.680 --> 44:16.960\n bad things to you.\n\n44:16.960 --> 44:23.400\n And so the very basic anger takes over, hate can take over.\n\n44:23.400 --> 44:31.040\n And then also just the excitement of almost like video game like, you know, aspect of\n\n44:31.040 --> 44:35.880\n war, like sport, it's like sport that all of those elements are all baked in and it's\n\n44:35.880 --> 44:40.000\n hard to be philosophical in that situation it seems like.\n\n44:40.000 --> 44:43.040\n I've never played video games so I can't compare it to that.\n\n44:43.040 --> 44:46.580\n But like from, from like a sports perspective, yeah, I could, I could argue that.\n\n44:46.580 --> 44:52.440\n Like I felt like we won there for a second and it's, it's not just like a heat from outside.\n\n44:52.440 --> 44:59.840\n It's like this radiation within you that is something I've never felt since.\n\n44:59.840 --> 45:05.120\n You just to take a small step back to the weapons training, what, what kind of guns\n\n45:05.120 --> 45:06.320\n did you train on?\n\n45:06.320 --> 45:08.120\n Because you also mentioned a rocket launcher.\n\n45:08.120 --> 45:10.480\n I love Carl Grossoff's.\n\n45:10.480 --> 45:11.480\n What are those?\n\n45:11.480 --> 45:12.480\n What are those?\n\n45:12.480 --> 45:13.480\n Carl G.\n\n45:13.480 --> 45:14.480\n Carl G's?\n\n45:14.480 --> 45:15.480\n What's that?\n\n45:15.480 --> 45:19.480\n What's it like, my only experience with the rocket launchers is from the movie Commando\n\n45:19.480 --> 45:20.480\n with Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n45:20.480 --> 45:21.480\n Oh yeah.\n\n45:21.480 --> 45:22.480\n And we've all discussed.\n\n45:22.480 --> 45:23.480\n I haven't seen that yet.\n\n45:23.480 --> 45:24.480\n And I've heard about it and people have made me tell.\n\n45:24.480 --> 45:25.480\n Yeah, I know.\n\n45:25.480 --> 45:30.560\n I feel like you haven't seen a single movie that's relevant to war military because every\n\n45:30.560 --> 45:33.080\n time anyone brings it up, you say you haven't seen it.\n\n45:33.080 --> 45:35.120\n I don't have time to watch movies, Lex.\n\n45:35.120 --> 45:36.120\n Platoon.\n\n45:36.120 --> 45:38.640\n You haven't seen Platoon, which is, you're the scientist.\n\n45:38.640 --> 45:40.240\n How do you have the time?\n\n45:40.240 --> 45:41.240\n I'm not a scientist.\n\n45:41.240 --> 45:43.240\n I just play one on TV.\n\n45:43.240 --> 45:44.240\n Okay.\n\n45:44.240 --> 45:45.240\n Sure.\n\n45:45.240 --> 45:51.000\n So what, can you talk about the rocket launcher and maybe any other, for both engineering\n\n45:51.000 --> 45:55.040\n actually, to me, those guns are very interesting from an engineering perspective too.\n\n45:55.040 --> 45:56.080\n Well, they should be.\n\n45:56.080 --> 46:00.280\n They're fascinating when you take them apart and you see how small the parts get down to\n\n46:00.280 --> 46:03.880\n and how necessary every single little piece is to make that thing run.\n\n46:03.880 --> 46:08.960\n And even without the tiniest little BB smaller than a piece on there, an artillery gun might\n\n46:08.960 --> 46:10.240\n not run.\n\n46:10.240 --> 46:17.120\n So we were trained on Carl G's, I think called M72s, which are disposable rocket launchers.\n\n46:17.120 --> 46:18.280\n I'll back up.\n\n46:18.280 --> 46:23.680\n Carl G's are around, I don't know the exact millimeter of the round.\n\n46:23.680 --> 46:24.800\n It's been a while since I shot them.\n\n46:24.800 --> 46:26.660\n We only did those in training.\n\n46:26.660 --> 46:31.960\n But essentially it takes, most people, one person can fire it, effectively hold it and\n\n46:31.960 --> 46:32.960\n fire it.\n\n46:32.960 --> 46:34.400\n It takes another person to load it.\n\n46:34.400 --> 46:39.840\n So you put it onto your shoulder and it weighs, I would, I don't know, 30 pounds, 40 pounds.\n\n46:39.840 --> 46:40.840\n Oh, wow.\n\n46:40.840 --> 46:41.840\n Can't remember.\n\n46:41.840 --> 46:42.840\n It's been a minute.\n\n46:42.840 --> 46:43.840\n It's been a minute.\n\n46:43.840 --> 46:44.840\n But one person can carry it.\n\n46:44.840 --> 46:45.840\n Oh, yeah.\n\n46:45.840 --> 46:46.840\n Okay.\n\n46:46.840 --> 46:47.840\n I don't know.\n\n46:47.840 --> 46:53.760\n It just seems like a rocket launcher is a pretty intense kind of device that just.\n\n46:53.760 --> 46:54.760\n It for sure is.\n\n46:54.760 --> 46:58.760\n I mean, it's the diameter, I can't even tell you the diameter, they're about that big.\n\n46:58.760 --> 46:59.760\n I mean.\n\n46:59.760 --> 47:00.760\n And it goes on your shoulder.\n\n47:00.760 --> 47:04.560\n It goes on your shoulder and then it has a little sight that pops out.\n\n47:04.560 --> 47:07.400\n That's almost like plastic like, which is kind of funny because it reminds me of like\n\n47:07.400 --> 47:11.120\n the little green army men.\n\n47:11.120 --> 47:13.160\n I just felt so flimsy to me.\n\n47:13.160 --> 47:15.240\n I was like, this is hilarious.\n\n47:15.240 --> 47:17.500\n And then another person stands behind you and opens the hatch.\n\n47:17.500 --> 47:23.040\n And so there's this, there's these two levers and you just kind of open it.\n\n47:23.040 --> 47:28.320\n And then the back end, which is flared, so it's just a tube and then it's flared.\n\n47:28.320 --> 47:32.200\n That will open it and drop down and you load a round into that and then you load it back\n\n47:32.200 --> 47:33.200\n up.\n\n47:33.200 --> 47:34.200\n Got it.\n\n47:34.200 --> 47:38.040\n And you're never supposed to stand behind it because the blast behind it will kill you.\n\n47:38.040 --> 47:40.080\n It's yeah.\n\n47:40.080 --> 47:46.280\n But in my case, when I fired it, it was me and another individual, I want to say it wasn't\n\n47:46.280 --> 47:49.640\n Sarah Pellegrin, but it was another girl that was smaller.\n\n47:49.640 --> 47:54.040\n And the person is supposed to wrap around your waist and tuck low and hold your stability.\n\n47:54.040 --> 47:58.320\n And we were just aiming at tanks that day and they were just concrete heads.\n\n47:58.320 --> 48:02.480\n So they would just either, they would hit and bounce off or whatever.\n\n48:02.480 --> 48:07.720\n And so when my sergeant saw that, he just kind of looked at both of us and was like,\n\n48:07.720 --> 48:08.920\n no, I'm just going to.\n\n48:08.920 --> 48:14.560\n And he got real low and just like wrapped both of us and then we'd fire it.\n\n48:14.560 --> 48:21.120\n And it feels like you're getting punched in the side of the head on repeat by Jocko.\n\n48:21.120 --> 48:27.320\n You lose all your hearing, like just, snot comes out of your nose and you're just kind\n\n48:27.320 --> 48:29.720\n of discombobulated for a minute.\n\n48:29.720 --> 48:32.400\n It's a real mind fuck.\n\n48:32.400 --> 48:39.720\n Is there any other kind of guns that at that time, because you were new to this, you haven't\n\n48:39.720 --> 48:44.440\n shot guns when you were younger that were really impressive to you in the training process?\n\n48:44.440 --> 48:46.740\n All of them, because I've never fired a weapon.\n\n48:46.740 --> 48:52.560\n So we had the C7s, which are like your M16s, I believe, the long barrel.\n\n48:52.560 --> 48:57.280\n The cute thing about those is when I have that slung, my barrel drags on the ground.\n\n48:57.280 --> 48:59.240\n So that's fun.\n\n48:59.240 --> 49:02.640\n And they shoot your 7.62 or your 5.56 round.\n\n49:02.640 --> 49:03.640\n I loved that.\n\n49:03.640 --> 49:08.920\n I preferred the C8, which was a short barrel, which is what the SF guys use.\n\n49:08.920 --> 49:13.320\n Not because it's cooler looking, which it obviously is, but because it was functional\n\n49:13.320 --> 49:16.840\n for my body height and it didn't drag on the ground when I ran.\n\n49:16.840 --> 49:17.840\n I loved those.\n\n49:17.840 --> 49:19.920\n They're your personal weapon.\n\n49:19.920 --> 49:22.780\n Being an artillery gunner, if you're not an officer, at least in our unit, you didn't\n\n49:22.780 --> 49:25.280\n get a side piece.\n\n49:25.280 --> 49:27.680\n I didn't have a slide piece, Lex.\n\n49:27.680 --> 49:30.800\n So I never had a handgun of any type.\n\n49:30.800 --> 49:32.000\n I fired those in training.\n\n49:32.000 --> 49:33.320\n You can't get over that side piece comment.\n\n49:33.320 --> 49:34.320\n Look at you.\n\n49:34.320 --> 49:36.880\n I was going to say, I know what a side piece is.\n\n49:36.880 --> 49:37.880\n You don't have to explain to me.\n\n49:37.880 --> 49:38.880\n But you're single.\n\n49:38.880 --> 49:41.720\n So how do you even have a side piece if you don't have a main piece?\n\n49:41.720 --> 49:46.240\n The joke would be the fact that we have a total misunderstanding what side piece is.\n\n49:46.240 --> 49:47.240\n Okay, great.\n\n49:47.240 --> 49:48.840\n So you didn't have a side piece as a non officer.\n\n49:48.840 --> 49:49.840\n Right.\n\n49:49.840 --> 49:51.200\n So I never fired those much.\n\n49:51.200 --> 49:52.520\n We did grenades in training.\n\n49:52.520 --> 49:53.520\n Oh, cool.\n\n49:53.520 --> 49:54.520\n Yeah, grenades are fun.\n\n49:54.520 --> 49:55.520\n I love grenades.\n\n49:55.520 --> 49:56.860\n I have a massive one tattooed on me.\n\n49:56.860 --> 49:58.320\n I have them all over my office.\n\n49:58.320 --> 50:00.520\n How does a grenade work?\n\n50:00.520 --> 50:02.340\n There's the spoon and the pin.\n\n50:02.340 --> 50:08.480\n So this the pin holds the spoon in place when you pull that pin, the firing mechanism inside\n\n50:08.480 --> 50:13.560\n as long as that the spoon is up against it, it won't fire as soon as that spoon goes.\n\n50:13.560 --> 50:16.760\n I believe it causes a reaction on the inside.\n\n50:16.760 --> 50:18.520\n And you've got about five seconds to check it.\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:20.920\n You'd be better to ask that question too.\n\n50:20.920 --> 50:22.680\n I don't mean to get philosophical on this.\n\n50:22.680 --> 50:23.680\n No, you're not.\n\n50:23.680 --> 50:30.280\n There's something about a grenade, because you're essentially committing suicide.\n\n50:30.280 --> 50:32.520\n Unless you get rid of the thing.\n\n50:32.520 --> 50:33.520\n There's something like\n\n50:33.520 --> 50:36.820\n or if you're unlucky, and it just goes off when you pull the pin, which has happened\n\n50:36.820 --> 50:37.820\n to tons of people.\n\n50:37.820 --> 50:41.120\n So it just feels like a very kind of leap.\n\n50:41.120 --> 50:45.680\n It's a dangerous leap into the abyss every time you use the thing.\n\n50:45.680 --> 50:50.040\n Because when you shoot a gun, like the gun is much less likely to malfunction in terms\n\n50:50.040 --> 50:52.480\n of like all the possible ways to go wrong.\n\n50:52.480 --> 50:55.000\n It just seems like grenade is like\n\n50:55.000 --> 50:56.000\n primitive almost.\n\n50:56.000 --> 50:57.560\n Yeah, it's primitive.\n\n50:57.560 --> 51:01.920\n It's also real, like in a way that like a bar fight is like being punched in the face\n\n51:01.920 --> 51:02.920\n is real.\n\n51:02.920 --> 51:05.960\n It's like you're here with a weapon of destruction.\n\n51:05.960 --> 51:07.440\n It's just you and the thing.\n\n51:07.440 --> 51:08.760\n Yeah, you have to get rid of it.\n\n51:08.760 --> 51:09.760\n I don't know.\n\n51:09.760 --> 51:11.240\n Is that is that terrifying to you?\n\n51:11.240 --> 51:13.840\n Like do people still use grenades in warfare?\n\n51:13.840 --> 51:14.840\n Oh, yeah.\n\n51:14.840 --> 51:15.840\n Okay.\n\n51:15.840 --> 51:16.840\n Yeah, those are fantastic.\n\n51:16.840 --> 51:20.120\n The Taliban were throwing them over the wall at the airport in Kabul.\n\n51:20.120 --> 51:23.040\n People use them all the time because when you're in Afghanistan, if you're in a rural\n\n51:23.040 --> 51:26.020\n area, you're going from village to village and they're, they're, you know, they're mud\n\n51:26.020 --> 51:30.480\n hot walls, like they're tall, but you're walking through corridors and stuff, all you got to\n\n51:30.480 --> 51:33.840\n lob one of those is going to take the whole unit out that just walked by like it's, they're\n\n51:33.840 --> 51:39.760\n accurate if you're close enough and they're effective if you're close enough.\n\n51:39.760 --> 51:41.640\n I love them though.\n\n51:41.640 --> 51:47.960\n I think they're fascinating to me because they're such a tiny little thing with such\n\n51:47.960 --> 51:48.960\n devastation.\n\n51:48.960 --> 51:51.160\n Yeah, they just can cause such devastation.\n\n51:51.160 --> 51:55.520\n But for me, when I had them, the some of the Canadians would make fun of me because when\n\n51:55.520 --> 51:59.280\n I did go outside the wire with the British, I had two right here.\n\n51:59.280 --> 52:04.560\n And I remember I put a piece of tape over the spoons because in my mind, I could picture\n\n52:04.560 --> 52:10.160\n myself searching someone and grabbing me and pulling that and that would be me that that\n\n52:10.160 --> 52:15.580\n would have been like, yep, that if anyone that was going to happen to was her for sure.\n\n52:15.580 --> 52:21.240\n So you were deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, okay.\n\n52:21.240 --> 52:26.240\n And like we said, you were in great, no, perfect physical shape.\n\n52:26.240 --> 52:27.240\n Fucking epic shape.\n\n52:27.240 --> 52:31.360\n Epic shape, six pack or, I mean, yeah, okay.\n\n52:31.360 --> 52:37.840\n So you could do pull up, a lot of pull ups and push ups and yeah, okay.\n\n52:37.840 --> 52:43.580\n And well trained, would you say, were you already what like, no, no, no, I'll argue\n\n52:43.580 --> 52:45.800\n that point till I'm blue in the face.\n\n52:45.800 --> 52:47.920\n I spoke to recently, I actually spoke to my sergeant.\n\n52:47.920 --> 52:48.920\n He's not a sergeant anymore.\n\n52:48.920 --> 52:51.760\n But Sergeant Mark LeBlanc, he's in Africa right now on a deployment.\n\n52:51.760 --> 52:52.760\n He gave me a call the other day.\n\n52:52.760 --> 52:54.840\n And I remember talking to him about this.\n\n52:54.840 --> 52:58.760\n And it's frustrating because we were at an active war.\n\n52:58.760 --> 53:03.360\n We were sorry, we were involved in an active war where we the units that I were in were\n\n53:03.360 --> 53:07.420\n tagged red, which meant they needed people.\n\n53:07.420 --> 53:12.240\n So when you need people, things go quick, whether or not that's right.\n\n53:12.240 --> 53:15.920\n I mean, you could argue that's the similar thing to what's happening in the world right\n\n53:15.920 --> 53:16.920\n now.\n\n53:16.920 --> 53:18.080\n We needed a vaccine.\n\n53:18.080 --> 53:19.880\n We got a vaccine.\n\n53:19.880 --> 53:21.600\n Is it the best it could be?\n\n53:21.600 --> 53:22.920\n Could it be better?\n\n53:22.920 --> 53:23.920\n Could it do more things?\n\n53:23.920 --> 53:24.920\n Sure, probably.\n\n53:24.920 --> 53:29.340\n But with the time that we had, we did the best that we could.\n\n53:29.340 --> 53:31.060\n That's my logic on that.\n\n53:31.060 --> 53:35.480\n For me, I joined the military in November of 2007.\n\n53:35.480 --> 53:38.840\n I was in basic training in January of 2008.\n\n53:38.840 --> 53:43.120\n I was graduated basic SQ, which is all your weapons training.\n\n53:43.120 --> 53:47.520\n Your DP1, which is your trade specific training.\n\n53:47.520 --> 53:51.360\n So whatever trade you're going to go into, whether it's infantry, armored, artillery,\n\n53:51.360 --> 53:54.180\n medic, whatever, that's your DP1.\n\n53:54.180 --> 53:56.480\n It's called different things in different units.\n\n53:56.480 --> 54:00.360\n And then I got posted to my unit in September.\n\n54:00.360 --> 54:03.320\n So January to September, I had done all my training.\n\n54:03.320 --> 54:05.780\n And I'm an English speaking individual.\n\n54:05.780 --> 54:10.520\n I got posted to a French unit that only speaks French and had to learn all of the weapons\n\n54:10.520 --> 54:15.720\n systems, everything, again, that I just learned in that short time frame in French.\n\n54:15.720 --> 54:21.480\n This part of your story that you're telling this to Jaco is one way to say it is very\n\n54:21.480 --> 54:24.880\n impressive that you had to learn all of this in French.\n\n54:24.880 --> 54:28.960\n So there's also the camaraderie, the social aspect of it, which is difficult, probably.\n\n54:28.960 --> 54:29.960\n I didn't have any.\n\n54:29.960 --> 54:32.360\n Yeah, I didn't have any.\n\n54:32.360 --> 54:37.440\n But it also would make you a more effective soldier to be socially, for that cohesion\n\n54:37.440 --> 54:39.280\n to be there, right?\n\n54:39.280 --> 54:42.400\n But also just understanding the basic terminology.\n\n54:42.400 --> 54:43.400\n Correct.\n\n54:43.400 --> 54:48.040\n The right way to say something on the radio, the right way to run a gun, the right way\n\n54:48.040 --> 54:52.540\n to, because you got to move with those guns, you got seven people.\n\n54:52.540 --> 54:54.840\n It's really magical.\n\n54:54.840 --> 54:56.200\n I'll send you a video.\n\n54:56.200 --> 55:00.380\n When we did some live fire in workup training in Texas before we left, we did a competition\n\n55:00.380 --> 55:05.680\n between the other gun to see who could fire 10 rounds faster.\n\n55:05.680 --> 55:12.960\n It is truly beautiful to watch an artillery unit fire a gun because it's like a symphony.\n\n55:12.960 --> 55:16.400\n Everyone has their parts and everyone knows and everyone's yelling, but they know why\n\n55:16.400 --> 55:20.880\n they're yelling and everyone, this guy's got to do this in order for this guy to load the\n\n55:20.880 --> 55:21.880\n round.\n\n55:21.880 --> 55:22.880\n It's just, it's beautiful.\n\n55:22.880 --> 55:23.960\n It really is.\n\n55:23.960 --> 55:25.120\n It is gorgeous to watch.\n\n55:25.120 --> 55:26.120\n I miss it deeply.\n\n55:26.120 --> 55:30.920\n Is there, by the way, for a gun, is there like one person responsible for the, for\n\n55:30.920 --> 55:36.440\n the aim and the, or like the specification of the location and somebody else that pulls\n\n55:36.440 --> 55:37.440\n it, presses the button?\n\n55:37.440 --> 55:38.440\n The lanyard.\n\n55:38.440 --> 55:39.440\n Is that the lanyard?\n\n55:39.440 --> 55:40.440\n The button.\n\n55:40.440 --> 55:41.440\n Is there a button?\n\n55:41.440 --> 55:42.440\n It's better than a button.\n\n55:42.440 --> 55:43.440\n You'll like it.\n\n55:43.440 --> 55:44.440\n I'll tell you in a second.\n\n55:44.440 --> 55:45.440\n Okay.\n\n55:45.440 --> 55:51.120\n There's your Sergeant in charge and then they have their two IC and so the comms come in\n\n55:51.120 --> 55:57.120\n to the Sergeant and the Sergeant is the, or your Master Bombardier, Bombardier Chef.\n\n55:57.120 --> 55:58.120\n Yeah.\n\n55:58.120 --> 55:59.120\n Sorry.\n\n55:59.120 --> 56:00.120\n What?\n\n56:00.120 --> 56:01.120\n Bombardier Chef?\n\n56:01.120 --> 56:02.120\n What?\n\n56:02.120 --> 56:03.120\n Bombardier Chef.\n\n56:03.120 --> 56:04.120\n Bombardier Chef.\n\n56:04.120 --> 56:05.120\n Oh, that's the French.\n\n56:05.120 --> 56:06.120\n Master Bombardier.\n\n56:06.120 --> 56:07.120\n Yeah.\n\n56:07.120 --> 56:10.920\n So it goes like private in the North, like in an infantry or in a regular unit, it's\n\n56:10.920 --> 56:15.300\n like private corporal, Master Corporal Sergeant.\n\n56:15.300 --> 56:22.660\n In artillery, it goes Gunner, Bombardier, Master Bombardier, Sergeant and off like that.\n\n56:22.660 --> 56:27.420\n So you have two people, but the Sarge is like, you don't move till he says move.\n\n56:27.420 --> 56:29.120\n You don't fire till he says fire.\n\n56:29.120 --> 56:30.120\n Like he's your guy.\n\n56:30.120 --> 56:31.120\n He'll give you the coordinates.\n\n56:31.120 --> 56:34.760\n He'll feed them to the guy that's doing the GPS, that portion.\n\n56:34.760 --> 56:36.120\n I really never did it much.\n\n56:36.120 --> 56:38.240\n I wasn't tall enough to see it.\n\n56:38.240 --> 56:40.560\n Like legitimately the way, how high it is up on the gun.\n\n56:40.560 --> 56:42.840\n Like it was, I couldn't see clearly enough.\n\n56:42.840 --> 56:44.480\n It was not good.\n\n56:44.480 --> 56:48.000\n So obviously you have a big personality, you're a strong person.\n\n56:48.000 --> 56:49.000\n You don't say.\n\n56:49.000 --> 56:51.800\n And you have a big hat currently.\n\n56:51.800 --> 56:54.400\n I always wear a hat, Lex.\n\n56:54.400 --> 56:57.480\n It seems like your height and your size was a factor.\n\n56:57.480 --> 56:58.560\n Oh, for sure.\n\n56:58.560 --> 57:04.560\n How were you able to step up in all those moments and how difficult was it?\n\n57:04.560 --> 57:07.600\n I don't know that I realized it was difficult while I was doing it because that's just the\n\n57:07.600 --> 57:08.600\n way it's been.\n\n57:08.600 --> 57:10.000\n I've always been the short person.\n\n57:10.000 --> 57:11.580\n That's life.\n\n57:11.580 --> 57:12.580\n Nothing I can do to fix that.\n\n57:12.580 --> 57:13.580\n So there was no point.\n\n57:13.580 --> 57:14.580\n Am I going to whine about it?\n\n57:14.580 --> 57:18.000\n I'm going to break my femurs and insert things to make me grow a little bit.\n\n57:18.000 --> 57:22.520\n Maybe, maybe since you're in robotics, you can figure that out.\n\n57:22.520 --> 57:24.400\n That's your task now.\n\n57:24.400 --> 57:28.600\n Make me be five foot three, that'd be great.\n\n57:28.600 --> 57:33.960\n For artillery, really what it came down to was the unit when I got there, there was only\n\n57:33.960 --> 57:38.920\n a couple of people who spoke any sort of English and my Sergeant was not one of them.\n\n57:38.920 --> 57:43.920\n But once he kind of started to get to know me a little bit, the best that he could, he\n\n57:43.920 --> 57:49.880\n started to put effort into making sure I could lift the rounds, make sure my capacity to\n\n57:49.880 --> 57:51.800\n do my job was there.\n\n57:51.800 --> 57:54.280\n And so he took me under his wing in that aspect.\n\n57:54.280 --> 58:01.080\n So he would take me to the gym with him and he would show me exercises that would specifically\n\n58:01.080 --> 58:03.760\n help me load the round.\n\n58:03.760 --> 58:07.840\n So pick the round up from the ground, pick it up like a trick to put your knee under\n\n58:07.840 --> 58:12.360\n it, use your legs instead of just pick it up, use your back, pull your back out.\n\n58:12.360 --> 58:13.820\n He would work on that.\n\n58:13.820 --> 58:18.800\n And then depending on the position I was running the gun in, if I was running the side that\n\n58:18.800 --> 58:23.000\n had the charge bags, I'll explain that in a second, but if I was running the side that\n\n58:23.000 --> 58:31.560\n had the charge bags, I could step up onto the gun and if I leaned inward enough with\n\n58:31.560 --> 58:39.000\n my right hand with the charge and I kind of kicked off, I could kind of jump and shove\n\n58:39.000 --> 58:41.680\n it up the tube.\n\n58:41.680 --> 58:42.680\n Almost enough.\n\n58:42.680 --> 58:43.680\n Yeah.\n\n58:43.680 --> 58:47.360\n If I was running the lanyard, which is the thing that makes it go boom, it's really easy.\n\n58:47.360 --> 58:49.140\n It's a long rope.\n\n58:49.140 --> 58:53.600\n You hook it on and you put your right hand on your hip and on your left and you hold\n\n58:53.600 --> 58:57.360\n it there and you just stare at your Sergeant like this and you just wait for him to yell\n\n58:57.360 --> 58:59.940\n fire and he points at you when he does it.\n\n58:59.940 --> 59:03.480\n And when you do it, you turn your whole body with it.\n\n59:03.480 --> 59:09.520\n And when you do that, it alleviates a misfire essentially because if you just pull it sometimes\n\n59:09.520 --> 59:10.520\n that's not enough.\n\n59:10.520 --> 59:12.740\n You got to really give it your whole body into it.\n\n59:12.740 --> 59:18.680\n And so he would train me on how to do things differently so that I could do them effectively\n\n59:18.680 --> 59:20.800\n and I wasn't a shit pump.\n\n59:20.800 --> 59:22.140\n A what?\n\n59:22.140 --> 59:26.040\n So shit pump is a term that we use in Canada to call somebody useless.\n\n59:26.040 --> 59:32.160\n A shit pump is a useless soldier who is just, you're there and that's the shit pump and\n\n59:32.160 --> 59:33.960\n so we all just deal with it.\n\n59:33.960 --> 59:35.880\n But somehow they're still there.\n\n59:35.880 --> 59:36.880\n Yeah.\n\n59:36.880 --> 59:37.880\n What were we talking about?\n\n59:37.880 --> 59:38.880\n The lanyard.\n\n59:38.880 --> 59:39.880\n Okay.\n\n59:39.880 --> 59:40.880\n Yeah.\n\n59:40.880 --> 59:41.880\n We were talking about the artillery guns.\n\n59:41.880 --> 59:48.160\n So those things though, what you would find fascinating is just how they break down when\n\n59:48.160 --> 59:49.560\n you have to take one of those apart.\n\n59:49.560 --> 59:55.400\n I think your mind would really find it fascinating how a breach comes apart all the way down\n\n59:55.400 --> 59:59.960\n to like ball bearing size and the only, and there's a way to just make that gun complete\n\n59:59.960 --> 1:00:05.760\n ineffective and all you have to do when you're on the charge side, there's a magazine that's\n\n1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:09.240\n a long linear magazine and it holds like 15 little rounds.\n\n1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:13.080\n If you just take that thing out, that thing's not firing.\n\n1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:14.840\n How many people does it take to move that?\n\n1:00:14.840 --> 1:00:16.440\n Like how easy is it to move that thing?\n\n1:00:16.440 --> 1:00:17.440\n To move a triple seven?\n\n1:00:17.440 --> 1:00:18.440\n A triple seven.\n\n1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:19.440\n I like it.\n\n1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:20.440\n Well that's what they're called.\n\n1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:21.440\n M triple sevens.\n\n1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:25.160\n Is a lot of the terminology crossover the same in English and French?\n\n1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:26.160\n Okay.\n\n1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:30.480\n I mean, M triple seven does cause it's an obvious how it's, or I'm sure it has a separate\n\n1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:33.500\n word, but like if you're running it, you're running it in French.\n\n1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:40.160\n So like when I'd be running the, when I'm doing the charge bags and I'm doing, I'm doing,\n\n1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:43.900\n you know, I'm loading everything and I'm getting that ready and that's my position that day,\n\n1:00:43.900 --> 1:00:46.760\n I'm also controlling the breach.\n\n1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:50.320\n So like how it opens, how it closes when it locks.\n\n1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:52.820\n And so, but you have to yell that as you do it.\n\n1:00:52.820 --> 1:00:57.480\n So you're yelling like, like you have to yell all these things.\n\n1:00:57.480 --> 1:00:59.100\n You have to learn them though.\n\n1:00:59.100 --> 1:01:03.480\n And so for a long time, it's, it's, it's, it was a little frustrating.\n\n1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:04.480\n I won't lie.\n\n1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:05.480\n It's really exciting.\n\n1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:09.880\n I took a lot of French, but I forgot all of it, but I think it's a beautiful romantic\n\n1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:10.880\n language.\n\n1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:11.880\n It's a good language.\n\n1:01:11.880 --> 1:01:14.040\n If it's from Quebec, it's a, yeah, that's true.\n\n1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:16.320\n It's a good language to fall in love with.\n\n1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:21.080\n Not as good as Russian, but I mean, English is, all right.\n\n1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:24.280\n I mean, Russian, are we really, is that like a love language?\n\n1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:25.280\n It is to me.\n\n1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:28.920\n I mean, because you're Russian, but like if somebody walked up to me, it was like, Hey,\n\n1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:33.100\n Kelsey, I like you, I'd be like, Oh God, he's going to put me in a camp.\n\n1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:35.320\n That's because you don't understand love, Kelsey.\n\n1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:36.320\n I don't.\n\n1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:37.320\n We'll talk about that.\n\n1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:38.320\n Okay.\n\n1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:40.120\n How many people does it take to move the M777?\n\n1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:41.120\n It depends.\n\n1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:43.640\n If you're moving it by ground, you're moving it on a truck and when you're moving it on\n\n1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:48.080\n a truck, you're hooking the back of it onto, you're hooking the front of the barrel onto\n\n1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:53.080\n one of those big transport looking trucks that has those cargo tents that's got soldiers\n\n1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:54.080\n in it.\n\n1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:57.000\n You don't want to ever move an M777 by that way, if you don't have to.\n\n1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:58.760\n The barrel is worth a million dollars.\n\n1:01:58.760 --> 1:01:59.760\n Wow.\n\n1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:00.760\n Okay.\n\n1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:02.040\n So this is like a serious piece of equipment.\n\n1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:03.240\n You don't want to move them.\n\n1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:04.240\n Okay.\n\n1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:07.800\n When we got to Kandahar, we were there for a couple of days.\n\n1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:12.240\n We got flown out to the FOB we were going to be at, forward observation base.\n\n1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:16.860\n Kandahar is the safe space or was the major base in Afghanistan that we were at.\n\n1:02:16.860 --> 1:02:19.140\n There's things like Tim Hortons there.\n\n1:02:19.140 --> 1:02:20.920\n There's Canada house.\n\n1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:24.280\n There's a British side, an American side, a Canadian side, and that's where you see\n\n1:02:24.280 --> 1:02:26.940\n all the different countries in the world kind of come together.\n\n1:02:26.940 --> 1:02:30.480\n You would see Italians, you would see Germans, you would see French, you would see all these\n\n1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:33.600\n different uniforms and you never know who to salute because you don't know what each\n\n1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:34.600\n thing means.\n\n1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:36.480\n It doesn't feel like a war zone.\n\n1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:37.480\n No.\n\n1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:38.480\n Oh God, no.\n\n1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:39.480\n There's a boardwalk.\n\n1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:41.840\n There's hockey there, like floor hockey because Canada had to have that.\n\n1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:46.880\n There's a Tim Hortons, a Subway, a Pizza Hut, a PX.\n\n1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:51.440\n I think there's a restaurant there somewhere, but I didn't get to go.\n\n1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:52.440\n Stuff like that.\n\n1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:53.440\n There's gyms.\n\n1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:54.440\n You can run around it.\n\n1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:55.440\n You feel fairly safe.\n\n1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:57.400\n You always have a weapon on you, but you can live your life.\n\n1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:02.120\n When you get out to the FOB, the guns are already there.\n\n1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:04.560\n Those M777s get lifted by a Chinook.\n\n1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:07.760\n Normally if they're going by air, they go by Chinook because they're heavy as hell.\n\n1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:12.160\n And Chinooks can hook them under the bottom and they fly them and then they'll drop them\n\n1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:13.160\n down.\n\n1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:18.320\n They have wheels on them, but you don't need them if you're going to leave it in place.\n\n1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:19.320\n Got it.\n\n1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:21.680\n And you're getting information about IEDs.\n\n1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:25.080\n You're getting a lay of the land as to what's been going on in the country for the past\n\n1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:26.360\n six months.\n\n1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:30.040\n And this, you know nothing, you're just like, this is your first time you're getting deployed.\n\n1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:31.600\n So what was your deployment like?\n\n1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:36.840\n Can you tell the story of your deployment to Afghanistan?\n\n1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:39.120\n Like the whole deployment?\n\n1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:42.200\n Getting like actual deploying, not the deployment itself.\n\n1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:43.600\n What's the difference between the two?\n\n1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:46.520\n Well actually getting ready to deploy is a little different.\n\n1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:54.360\n So I mean the emotional buildup to it and some of the memorable things that kind of\n\n1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:59.320\n you remember from that experience, both on the excitement, I get to see battle, I get\n\n1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:04.680\n to be part of this and the fear and also like being surprised like with the Tim Hortons\n\n1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:05.680\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:09.320\n So like the lead up before everything like shit hit the fan, okay cool.\n\n1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:10.320\n So...\n\n1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:13.920\n You're such a fascinating person, but yes, yes.\n\n1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:14.920\n Something like that.\n\n1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:15.920\n Yes.\n\n1:04:15.920 --> 1:04:16.920\n I've been called...\n\n1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:17.920\n Many things.\n\n1:04:17.920 --> 1:04:18.920\n Yeah, fascinating.\n\n1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:19.920\n That start with the letter F.\n\n1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:20.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:21.920\n No, I don't know.\n\n1:04:21.920 --> 1:04:25.380\n I don't know many words with F. Okay, so the buildup to the deployment.\n\n1:04:25.380 --> 1:04:30.740\n So for the buildup for the deployment, I was in Quebec and my unit was deploying from Quebec.\n\n1:04:30.740 --> 1:04:34.680\n And at that time you kind of get your marching orders, you know you're deploying.\n\n1:04:34.680 --> 1:04:38.600\n I knew I was deploying before I even graduated.\n\n1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:39.980\n That's how much they needed people.\n\n1:04:39.980 --> 1:04:45.260\n So once I did all that training, on graduation parade day, a couple men from Quebec in uniforms\n\n1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:49.080\n came over and said, you, you, you and you are all being posted back here today and you're\n\n1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:51.080\n going to deploy with us in April.\n\n1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:52.680\n So that's how I found out I was deploying.\n\n1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:55.560\n Why was there such a need for troops in Afghanistan?\n\n1:04:55.560 --> 1:04:59.000\n That was a well known thing that there's a scaling up of troops.\n\n1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.960\n 2007 on, Canada really started taking a combat role.\n\n1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:06.600\n Before it was very much more a UN type deal where doing what we normally do in most wars\n\n1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:10.780\n where we just, we wear blue and we don't shoot anyone.\n\n1:05:10.780 --> 1:05:13.200\n And so we're there to help.\n\n1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:18.080\n And so they were really, they were scaling up and there wasn't a lot of people in those\n\n1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:20.280\n trades initially, I think when the war kind of started.\n\n1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.720\n So Canada really started to scale.\n\n1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:26.980\n And so when I got to Quebec, we've kind of found, oh yeah, we're deploying.\n\n1:05:26.980 --> 1:05:31.360\n And it was a weird situation because I've never actually been at a unit on a non deployable\n\n1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:32.360\n unit.\n\n1:05:32.360 --> 1:05:33.720\n I don't know what they do day to day.\n\n1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:34.720\n That's different from what I did.\n\n1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:36.640\n I just know what I did.\n\n1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:40.680\n So we would do things like in the morning we would get up and we would meet for PT at\n\n1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:48.060\n 5 a.m. and that would include going for a 10k run or playing ball hockey for a few hours\n\n1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:53.400\n in the gym or lifting weights together or just going on a rock march, a long rock march.\n\n1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:54.480\n Just stuff like that.\n\n1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:59.840\n You would have a shower, you would meet and then you would just sit around the regiment.\n\n1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:04.800\n You would just sit around the regiment and you would, if there was busy work, you'd mop\n\n1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:07.160\n the floors, you would clean weapons.\n\n1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:10.860\n There wasn't a whole lot until there was a whole lot to do.\n\n1:06:10.860 --> 1:06:17.260\n We did a lot for a while and then we went away on workup training to Texas for a week.\n\n1:06:17.260 --> 1:06:23.820\n We came down here and we did live fire with our other troop that was gonna be with us.\n\n1:06:23.820 --> 1:06:30.960\n So Alpha had two guns and two guns has two groups of people and so we all would go down\n\n1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:38.000\n to Texas and we did live fire here for a week and I ended up getting gastro which was awesome.\n\n1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:39.000\n So thanks for that.\n\n1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:43.600\n Oh apparently there was, they were having water problems and sanitary problems so everyone\n\n1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:45.600\n was getting it on the base.\n\n1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:48.920\n Okay so it just makes your life way harder.\n\n1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:52.600\n I didn't get it towards the end, till towards the end so that was fortunate.\n\n1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:56.920\n So we would fire live fire, we would go out to the middle of nowhere, the guns would be\n\n1:06:56.920 --> 1:07:02.280\n there and we would get offloaded truck of rounds and we would do live fire and we would\n\n1:07:02.280 --> 1:07:04.720\n practice, just constant practice.\n\n1:07:04.720 --> 1:07:05.980\n What's that saying?\n\n1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:07.200\n Perfect practice makes perfect.\n\n1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:13.880\n Yeah so this is a sensory, like a shooting range for artillery, for long range.\n\n1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:16.280\n So what does practice look like?\n\n1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:21.660\n So you roll up in your trucks and you're, you know, you've got each group of people.\n\n1:07:21.660 --> 1:07:24.720\n You've got two trucks and then you've got like a medic vehicle and then you've got like\n\n1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:30.560\n an officer vehicle and a comms vehicle and you go to your perspective guns and then you\n\n1:07:30.560 --> 1:07:37.000\n offload your ammo and then you basically wait for them to send you like a fire mission.\n\n1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000\n Wow, get that together.\n\n1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.600\n They would call, they would say a mission, so it would be a fire mission.\n\n1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:45.320\n So we'd wait for that and once we got that then you all run like a bunch of scattered\n\n1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:50.720\n rats to the gun like it's like the greatest thing you've ever seen and then you just wait,\n\n1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:54.440\n you wait for the call for the sergeants to say and then you'll hear it because it's not\n\n1:07:54.440 --> 1:07:55.440\n headphones.\n\n1:07:55.440 --> 1:07:59.720\n You can hear it on a speaker and it'd be like, I'm not going to do it in French, don't ask.\n\n1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:09.160\n It'd be like so and so, 10 rounds, fire when ready and then you would get your rounds ready\n\n1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:13.640\n and everyone would have them ready and would be in their respective positions and then\n\n1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:17.560\n you would wait and then they would say fire when ready and as soon as they say fire when\n\n1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:19.720\n ready that means just start going.\n\n1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:22.200\n Just start and then that's when the magic starts.\n\n1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:26.400\n You go like the loop, like you shoot one or whatever, there's a reloading process.\n\n1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:27.400\n Yeah, there's a loop.\n\n1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:31.080\n So what you would do, you get the fire mission, you would find out the rounds, the 2IC would\n\n1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:34.680\n be standing by the rounds and it was his job to make sure the amount of rounds that was\n\n1:08:34.680 --> 1:08:39.560\n told would be the only rounds that would go downrange and so he'd stand there and on each\n\n1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:45.240\n round depending on the type of round is a fuse which gets screwed onto the top of the round.\n\n1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:51.880\n So they're about that big and it's just a point and then you would have to put it on,\n\n1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:57.960\n give it a spin and depending if it was a time release, you had a little, what do you call\n\n1:08:57.960 --> 1:08:58.960\n it?\n\n1:08:58.960 --> 1:08:59.960\n You get those at IKEA when you have to build everything.\n\n1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:00.960\n Allen wrench?\n\n1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:01.960\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, Allen wrench.\n\n1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:02.960\n Yeah, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:03.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:04.960\n But like a big one or something?\n\n1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:07.060\n No, just a little one because it's a tiny little hole and you just got to click it to\n\n1:09:07.060 --> 1:09:12.240\n where it's supposed to go and it depended on what the call was for and it was a timer.\n\n1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:15.520\n When you said like wheel, you mean like a little thing then?\n\n1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:16.520\n Is that what we're talking about?\n\n1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:17.520\n No, no.\n\n1:09:17.520 --> 1:09:18.520\n I'm talking about the round itself.\n\n1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:20.480\n So you would put a fuse on top of the round.\n\n1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:25.240\n So you would unload the ammo and then you would put fuses on them and the fuses are\n\n1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:30.440\n on the top and they're like a little ice cream topper kind of thing and you would spin those\n\n1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:31.440\n on.\n\n1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:32.440\n Oh, okay.\n\n1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:35.280\n And then once they're on, depending if it's a time release or not, you would take this\n\n1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:39.240\n little thing and you would move it the top and that would, it's almost like a little\n\n1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:40.240\n timer.\n\n1:09:40.240 --> 1:09:41.240\n Cool.\n\n1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:42.240\n That's what I did.\n\n1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:43.840\n So you're assembling a bullet.\n\n1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:44.840\n Essentially.\n\n1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:47.240\n A very big one that goes up to my waist.\n\n1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.240\n Cool.\n\n1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:49.240\n Yes.\n\n1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:50.240\n This is very cool.\n\n1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:51.240\n And you're a fascinating person.\n\n1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:52.240\n Okay.\n\n1:09:52.240 --> 1:09:55.720\n So just that you still even years later have all this in your memory.\n\n1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:00.200\n It's not all perfectly accurate and that's what irritates me though is because it bothers\n\n1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:04.920\n me when I can't remember things accurately but I have a lot of, I've had a lot of memory\n\n1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:09.000\n issues and problems after like having too many hits to the head and...\n\n1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.880\n This is from earlier in childhood or later?\n\n1:10:10.880 --> 1:10:11.880\n But both.\n\n1:10:11.880 --> 1:10:12.880\n Okay.\n\n1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:13.880\n Both.\n\n1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:14.880\n The military did not help it.\n\n1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:18.160\n Where was the hits in the head in the military?\n\n1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:21.940\n Well when you have a Carl Gustav beside your face like this and it shoots around, it gives\n\n1:10:21.940 --> 1:10:23.460\n you a concussive blast.\n\n1:10:23.460 --> 1:10:27.300\n Also there's new research being done, I'll find out exactly what it is, but there's new\n\n1:10:27.300 --> 1:10:31.560\n research that's being done that shows that if you're an artillery gunner and you stand\n\n1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:36.280\n within a certain range of that gun, you get the same amount of concussive blasts and there's\n\n1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:37.280\n a range.\n\n1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:43.800\n I had no idea but you feel it when it goes off, like it hurt, your whole body feels it.\n\n1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:47.200\n Your mind is fascinating because it's like literally the opposite of mine.\n\n1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:50.520\n One you're able to speak very quickly, very clearly, very sharply.\n\n1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:51.520\n Sorry, sorry.\n\n1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:52.520\n No, what?\n\n1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:53.520\n I talk too fast and I'm pretty loud.\n\n1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:54.520\n No that's perfect.\n\n1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:55.520\n Because of my hearing.\n\n1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:56.520\n I admire, I mean I admire that very much.\n\n1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:01.840\n I can't do any of that and you listen extremely well and you're extremely attentive and you\n\n1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:02.840\n have a good memory.\n\n1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:09.240\n Anyway, it's just fun to watch you and I can tell you're a great soldier in just all different\n\n1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:10.240\n aspects of it.\n\n1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:12.120\n Thank you, I appreciate it.\n\n1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:13.480\n But what the heck we're talking about?\n\n1:11:13.480 --> 1:11:14.980\n Oh, build up to the deployment.\n\n1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:16.440\n How did we get to Texas?\n\n1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:18.320\n Because that was part of the build up to my deployment.\n\n1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:20.840\n And live fire you got to, did that feel good?\n\n1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:21.840\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:26.440\n It was so good.\n\n1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:32.280\n What's the favorite, what's the best part about like shooting artillery?\n\n1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:35.360\n Like what's the thing that feels good?\n\n1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:36.360\n Which part?\n\n1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:37.360\n Power.\n\n1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.700\n Well the feeling of power.\n\n1:11:38.700 --> 1:11:43.660\n When is the best moment of, the highest moment of the feeling of power?\n\n1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:48.640\n Is it the whole process that you love or is there like when you actually shoot it?\n\n1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:49.640\n It's symbiotic.\n\n1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:50.880\n It's a beautiful thing to watch.\n\n1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:56.520\n To know that a gun can fire and it takes kind of a dance to make it work.\n\n1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.940\n There's something about that to me that just got my heart racing.\n\n1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:06.280\n When you actually shoot the round and you see it go and you hear it, it's unlike, you\n\n1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:07.280\n can't describe.\n\n1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:09.840\n There's no, I've never felt another feeling.\n\n1:12:09.840 --> 1:12:14.820\n I've also never been in like an F18 or an F like 16 or like any, I've never been in\n\n1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:16.440\n anything like that.\n\n1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:20.520\n And I've, you know, I've never, trying to think of something else that'd be comparable.\n\n1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:22.440\n I've never been in like a Formula One car.\n\n1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:29.200\n Those are the only things I can picture being that much for me because to shoot one of those\n\n1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:34.540\n and to know that you've done your job right means that you've helped.\n\n1:12:34.540 --> 1:12:37.800\n And that to me was really what did it for me.\n\n1:12:37.800 --> 1:12:43.680\n When you hear your sergeant say, mission accomplished, target hit, tired acquired, then you're like,\n\n1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:47.000\n that's a good feeling, that's the stuff.\n\n1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.040\n Quick pause.\n\n1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:49.800\n Take a break Lex.\n\n1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:54.280\n Okay, so live fire in Texas, we're in Texas by the way.\n\n1:12:54.280 --> 1:12:56.520\n Fort Worth or Fort Hood, one of them.\n\n1:12:56.520 --> 1:13:00.000\n Well, okay, so like it's what, is that close to a big major city?\n\n1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.000\n Do you remember visiting a city?\n\n1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:07.360\n Oh God, no, we fly right into the tarmac and they're like, don't touch the snakes.\n\n1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.920\n And then they send you out to the field.\n\n1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:10.920\n Got it.\n\n1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:11.920\n Let's see the instructions.\n\n1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:15.360\n No, really, we went into a classroom and they're like, these are the animals that are in the\n\n1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:16.800\n wildlife in Texas.\n\n1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:18.740\n If you see any of them, do not approach.\n\n1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:19.940\n Do not go pee outside.\n\n1:13:19.940 --> 1:13:20.940\n Do not squat down.\n\n1:13:20.940 --> 1:13:22.200\n It is snake season people.\n\n1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:25.820\n And I was like, I have to pee and squat down.\n\n1:13:25.820 --> 1:13:31.000\n Why Texas and from like Canada, is it a simulation of Afghanistan?\n\n1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000\n Yes.\n\n1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:37.040\n Okay, so that's, okay, so you're getting, and that's the way the live fire was seen\n\n1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:41.840\n in artilleries, like you're trying to simulate certain aspects of what you might actually\n\n1:13:41.840 --> 1:13:42.960\n see in Afghanistan.\n\n1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:43.960\n I would think so.\n\n1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:50.400\n I mean, we, it, it looks like it's hot, like it, you're out in the middle of nowhere.\n\n1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:51.860\n Very similar terrain.\n\n1:13:51.860 --> 1:13:56.360\n That's the first time we started to get to wear our tan boots and our tan, like our combat\n\n1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:58.400\n tan stuff before you couldn't wear that.\n\n1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:01.840\n So it gave us an opportunity to kind of break in, break in how we were going to be doing\n\n1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:05.040\n this, what it was going to look like, how the guns were going to work and all of those\n\n1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:06.040\n lovely things.\n\n1:14:06.040 --> 1:14:10.240\n How do you go from there to being deployed?\n\n1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:12.280\n What was the next part of the journey?\n\n1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:17.480\n So then we go to Wainwright, Alberta, often called or referenced as Waincock because it\n\n1:14:17.480 --> 1:14:19.720\n sucks so bad.\n\n1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:25.560\n It is a massive open space in Alberta, which most of Alberta is, and it's outside of a\n\n1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:27.320\n small town called Wainwright.\n\n1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:32.800\n And it is a field X training area for all of the Canadian military.\n\n1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:38.120\n And it's where you do live fire, but you also do workup training.\n\n1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:40.480\n So you go out there for a month or two, I think it is.\n\n1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:44.080\n I don't remember the exact time we were there because it was just, you sleep in a tent,\n\n1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:47.940\n you're in your cot, you're in like full mission mode.\n\n1:14:47.940 --> 1:14:53.940\n And you go outside and we did this operation called Operation Maple Leaf, I think it was.\n\n1:14:53.940 --> 1:15:01.040\n And you put on these little suits, they have haptic, you can feel when you're shot.\n\n1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:05.900\n And then there's a little camera, sorry, screen in the front of it, and it's got button options.\n\n1:15:05.900 --> 1:15:09.580\n And so it's to mimic if you get shot, it'll say gunshot wound.\n\n1:15:09.580 --> 1:15:12.420\n And then you have to choose, okay, do I do this or do I do this?\n\n1:15:12.420 --> 1:15:15.540\n And depending on your response, person dies or lives.\n\n1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:19.860\n And they have other people who aren't on a rotation for deployment come and act as the\n\n1:15:19.860 --> 1:15:25.980\n Taliban and attack you in the middle of the night.\n\n1:15:25.980 --> 1:15:30.580\n Is there a good understanding of the tactics that the Taliban used to attack?\n\n1:15:30.580 --> 1:15:38.580\n I mean, this may be fast forwards to our conversation a little bit, but is there predictable strategies\n\n1:15:38.580 --> 1:15:42.360\n on the other side that are being used in Afghanistan?\n\n1:15:42.360 --> 1:15:43.360\n By the Taliban?\n\n1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:44.360\n By the Taliban.\n\n1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:45.360\n Oh, 100%.\n\n1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:50.740\n They had suicide bombers, vehicle born IEDs.\n\n1:15:50.740 --> 1:15:57.220\n Their standard way to hit people really was IEDs and vehicle born IEDs, suicide bombers.\n\n1:15:57.220 --> 1:16:03.020\n They'd put like backpacks full of an IED and then put like toys around it and then just\n\n1:16:03.020 --> 1:16:04.020\n be like.\n\n1:16:04.020 --> 1:16:07.300\n So they will conceal it certain ways and probably use civilians.\n\n1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:08.300\n Oh, 100%.\n\n1:16:08.300 --> 1:16:09.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:13.300\n And women were a great way to get close to the soldiers because women seem nonthreatening.\n\n1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:16.940\n When you see a burqa walk up to you, you're not expecting an AK 47 to roll out of that\n\n1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:21.260\n and then, or, you know, but there are great ways to get close.\n\n1:16:21.260 --> 1:16:22.260\n Okay.\n\n1:16:22.260 --> 1:16:24.380\n So what is it, Wayne something?\n\n1:16:24.380 --> 1:16:25.380\n Waynecock?\n\n1:16:25.380 --> 1:16:28.100\n No, that's not how, Wayne Wright.\n\n1:16:28.100 --> 1:16:29.100\n Let's go to Alberta.\n\n1:16:29.100 --> 1:16:30.100\n Okay.\n\n1:16:30.100 --> 1:16:31.100\n Okay.\n\n1:16:31.100 --> 1:16:32.100\n I mean, we don't have to go to Alberta.\n\n1:16:32.100 --> 1:16:33.100\n Nobody wants to.\n\n1:16:33.100 --> 1:16:37.100\n No, let's, in our minds, in our imagination.\n\n1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:38.100\n So okay.\n\n1:16:38.100 --> 1:16:40.140\n So that's getting you closer to Afghanistan.\n\n1:16:40.140 --> 1:16:41.140\n Right.\n\n1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:42.140\n What was that like?\n\n1:16:42.140 --> 1:16:44.020\n I mean, are you getting anxious at this point?\n\n1:16:44.020 --> 1:16:45.020\n Is there a buildup?\n\n1:16:45.020 --> 1:16:46.020\n What are you thinking?\n\n1:16:46.020 --> 1:16:47.900\n Or is this just all part of the training?\n\n1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:49.780\n For me, it was more part of the training.\n\n1:16:49.780 --> 1:16:54.660\n I was excited to go because I did know that we were going to do some live fire.\n\n1:16:54.660 --> 1:17:00.300\n I did know that we were going to be doing more of the military type job I thought we\n\n1:17:00.300 --> 1:17:03.860\n were going to be doing because up until that point, I had just done training.\n\n1:17:03.860 --> 1:17:07.220\n So I was learning how to march and salute and who to salute and not salute.\n\n1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:10.580\n Like that was the focus of, that was my experience of the military.\n\n1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:14.820\n And then the next experience was sitting in a regiment, just working out a lot and going\n\n1:17:14.820 --> 1:17:16.340\n for breakfast a lot and drinking.\n\n1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:18.740\n Like that was, I was like, this is the army.\n\n1:17:18.740 --> 1:17:23.700\n So when I actually got to go to Wainwright, I got my first full taste of, okay, well,\n\n1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:24.700\n there's fire picket duty.\n\n1:17:24.700 --> 1:17:28.500\n So one person gets picked every night to do sentry.\n\n1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:30.180\n There's a little less sleep.\n\n1:17:30.180 --> 1:17:32.580\n You're eating out of a canteen now.\n\n1:17:32.580 --> 1:17:33.580\n You're drinking out of canteen.\n\n1:17:33.580 --> 1:17:34.580\n You're in your kit more.\n\n1:17:34.580 --> 1:17:35.660\n You're in your deployable kit.\n\n1:17:35.660 --> 1:17:40.220\n Now you're in your, you know, you're wearing your tack vest.\n\n1:17:40.220 --> 1:17:42.220\n You're getting ready to practice having plates on.\n\n1:17:42.220 --> 1:17:44.320\n You're having ammunition on you.\n\n1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:45.980\n You've got your weapon with you all the time.\n\n1:17:45.980 --> 1:17:51.540\n When you're on base in Quebec, you're, you're just like an everyday job.\n\n1:17:51.540 --> 1:17:54.120\n Maybe you can paint a clearer picture to me.\n\n1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:56.540\n When was there an understanding that you're actually getting deployed?\n\n1:17:56.540 --> 1:18:00.740\n Was it just a sense that you're getting deployed or was this officially told to you?\n\n1:18:00.740 --> 1:18:04.460\n I was officially told on graduation day, you're deploying in April with Vac Hits.\n\n1:18:04.460 --> 1:18:05.460\n Oh, okay.\n\n1:18:05.460 --> 1:18:06.460\n There's a date.\n\n1:18:06.460 --> 1:18:12.060\n Like they, they knew, so what had happened is the reason that Vac Hits unit needed more\n\n1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:13.060\n people.\n\n1:18:13.060 --> 1:18:14.620\n So they came to that and they picked five people.\n\n1:18:14.620 --> 1:18:16.820\n There was five English speaking people that went to Vac Hits.\n\n1:18:16.820 --> 1:18:18.000\n It wasn't just myself.\n\n1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:21.320\n There was a couple other people I knew that were English speaking that got put on other\n\n1:18:21.320 --> 1:18:23.300\n guns within the regiment.\n\n1:18:23.300 --> 1:18:24.860\n I wasn't with any of them.\n\n1:18:24.860 --> 1:18:26.940\n We all kind of got split up.\n\n1:18:26.940 --> 1:18:33.700\n And so there was an understanding that we were going to always be deploying.\n\n1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:36.100\n Next year, it was like 2009, you're deploying.\n\n1:18:36.100 --> 1:18:41.300\n Whether you left in May or April, we were deploying because that was the rotation time.\n\n1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:44.420\n So each Canadian unit did between six and nine months.\n\n1:18:44.420 --> 1:18:49.340\n And then you knew right around that point, another base of individuals would then deploy.\n\n1:18:49.340 --> 1:18:51.300\n So you would go on these rotations.\n\n1:18:51.300 --> 1:18:56.560\n And so even when I was on my deployment then, I was slated to go again the following year,\n\n1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:58.280\n but towards the end of the year.\n\n1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:00.000\n So there was always a rotation.\n\n1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.500\n If you were in a combat arms unit and you were in one that was a deployable unit.\n\n1:19:03.500 --> 1:19:09.620\n So if you were from Edmonton, a PPCLI, which were the Princess Patricia's, which were their\n\n1:19:09.620 --> 1:19:10.880\n infantry unit.\n\n1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:16.360\n If you were RCR out of Petawawa, Ontario, you knew you were deploying.\n\n1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:19.020\n If you were at Vac Hits, you knew you were deploying.\n\n1:19:19.020 --> 1:19:22.000\n There's combat arms bases, and then there's like naval bases.\n\n1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:23.500\n I didn't know their deployment structure.\n\n1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:25.220\n I didn't know how they worked.\n\n1:19:25.220 --> 1:19:26.220\n I'm on the ground.\n\n1:19:26.220 --> 1:19:27.420\n Don't worry about the boats.\n\n1:19:27.420 --> 1:19:29.260\n So I didn't know how the Air Force deployed.\n\n1:19:29.260 --> 1:19:32.240\n I knew Vac Hits was deploying in April.\n\n1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:36.040\n You were going, get ready.\n\n1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:37.040\n That was that.\n\n1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:39.040\n So you show up to Afghanistan.\n\n1:19:39.040 --> 1:19:43.300\n What is a combat arms unit look like?\n\n1:19:43.300 --> 1:19:45.180\n What's the situation look like?\n\n1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:47.620\n How much chaos is there?\n\n1:19:47.620 --> 1:19:50.420\n How much clarity about mission is there?\n\n1:19:50.420 --> 1:19:52.300\n What are your feelings about the whole thing?\n\n1:19:52.300 --> 1:19:57.620\n So when you leave, the day you leave, we left Quebec, we got driven to the airport and then\n\n1:19:57.620 --> 1:20:01.740\n we walked onto the tarmac and we load our own bags and we got on a plane and it's just\n\n1:20:01.740 --> 1:20:02.740\n empty.\n\n1:20:02.740 --> 1:20:04.300\n It's just, it's our plane.\n\n1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.180\n And you don't go right to Afghanistan.\n\n1:20:06.180 --> 1:20:10.420\n You go to a stopover point, which I don't know if I'm allowed to say where that is frankly.\n\n1:20:10.420 --> 1:20:12.960\n So I just say it's somewhere overseas.\n\n1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:16.860\n And you go there and you go there for a couple of days, I think it's like a day or two.\n\n1:20:16.860 --> 1:20:18.720\n And that's where you get like your kit.\n\n1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:21.340\n That's where you get your bulletproof plates for the first time and realize how heavy those\n\n1:20:21.340 --> 1:20:22.340\n fucking things are.\n\n1:20:22.340 --> 1:20:26.540\n It's where you get your weapon and your ammunition, your first few mags.\n\n1:20:26.540 --> 1:20:31.300\n It's where you get your helmet and your vests and you get everything that you need.\n\n1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:34.140\n While you're there, it's pretty nonchalant.\n\n1:20:34.140 --> 1:20:35.140\n It's hot as hell.\n\n1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:36.980\n It's your first time being in that kind of heat.\n\n1:20:36.980 --> 1:20:38.860\n So you just never stop sweating.\n\n1:20:38.860 --> 1:20:42.220\n The place we were in, it's just the second you got out of the shower, you were still\n\n1:20:42.220 --> 1:20:43.420\n wet after you got out.\n\n1:20:43.420 --> 1:20:44.580\n What the hell is happening?\n\n1:20:44.580 --> 1:20:46.100\n It's so humid.\n\n1:20:46.100 --> 1:20:47.580\n And I'm like, is this going to be like this in Afghanistan?\n\n1:20:47.580 --> 1:20:49.300\n They're like, no, it's not humid there at all.\n\n1:20:49.300 --> 1:20:51.260\n I'm like, why is it so bad here?\n\n1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:52.620\n They're like, it'll be fine.\n\n1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:53.940\n Don't worry about it.\n\n1:20:53.940 --> 1:20:58.540\n So and where we were there, it was kind of cute.\n\n1:20:58.540 --> 1:21:04.460\n We were like in a base, within a base and they had like turf and we had like ice cream\n\n1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:09.660\n and fruit and you could go get on a computer, you could go make calls, you had showers,\n\n1:21:09.660 --> 1:21:10.940\n you had a real bed.\n\n1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:14.540\n It was very kind of okay for that point.\n\n1:21:14.540 --> 1:21:17.380\n And then you got all your stuff and then okay, we're rolling out, which is about a five hour\n\n1:21:17.380 --> 1:21:18.380\n flight.\n\n1:21:18.380 --> 1:21:23.380\n Again, my experience with helicopters is mostly from another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie,\n\n1:21:23.380 --> 1:21:24.380\n The Predator.\n\n1:21:24.380 --> 1:21:29.620\n I'm not, do you want me to say I've never seen it?\n\n1:21:29.620 --> 1:21:30.620\n I've never seen it.\n\n1:21:30.620 --> 1:21:31.620\n Lex, do you feel better about yourself?\n\n1:21:31.620 --> 1:21:37.100\n No, you want to tell the audience the, all the excellent shows that you mentioned me\n\n1:21:37.100 --> 1:21:40.060\n offline that you watch instead, instead of Platoon.\n\n1:21:40.060 --> 1:21:41.060\n Listen.\n\n1:21:41.060 --> 1:21:43.700\n Yeah, this, nine is Sex and the City.\n\n1:21:43.700 --> 1:21:44.700\n Was that more important than Platoon?\n\n1:21:44.700 --> 1:21:46.460\n Oh no, I've never seen that.\n\n1:21:46.460 --> 1:21:47.460\n Don't, don't put me in that category.\n\n1:21:47.460 --> 1:21:48.460\n Why?\n\n1:21:48.460 --> 1:21:49.460\n Did you just put me in a box?\n\n1:21:49.460 --> 1:21:50.460\n I did.\n\n1:21:50.460 --> 1:21:51.460\n I watch like Homeland.\n\n1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:55.020\n I watch, no, I watch like, I watch a lot of documentaries.\n\n1:21:55.020 --> 1:22:00.420\n I watch, I like to watch real, real things more than, than, than just film.\n\n1:22:00.420 --> 1:22:06.580\n I did a little bit of film stuff when I got back into Canada and I was like, once you're,\n\n1:22:06.580 --> 1:22:09.420\n once you've seen how it's made, I'm like, I don't want to do that.\n\n1:22:09.420 --> 1:22:10.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:11.700\n I mean, I'm the same way as superhero movies.\n\n1:22:11.700 --> 1:22:17.340\n It doesn't, I want, I want, I want something closer to reality, but then movies like Platoon\n\n1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:21.140\n reveal some deep aspect of reality without it.\n\n1:22:21.140 --> 1:22:22.860\n I did Superman Man of Steel.\n\n1:22:22.860 --> 1:22:25.900\n Wait, you, sorry, you, you were, what do you mean you did?\n\n1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:31.180\n I was not a military expert, but I was a stunt expert, even though I didn't actually have\n\n1:22:31.180 --> 1:22:32.220\n to do any stunts.\n\n1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:34.740\n It's just because I had previous military experience and they were going to have me\n\n1:22:34.740 --> 1:22:36.580\n as an extra as a military person.\n\n1:22:36.580 --> 1:22:39.500\n But if you have previous experience, they have to make it as like a stunt role, like\n\n1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:40.500\n so you get paid more.\n\n1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:41.500\n Got it.\n\n1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:45.580\n So I got to sit at a desk and I was in that, I was in that like, you'd see me like, whew,\n\n1:22:45.580 --> 1:22:46.740\n for like two seconds.\n\n1:22:46.740 --> 1:22:50.220\n So what you're saying is you were the mastermind behind that movie.\n\n1:22:50.220 --> 1:22:51.860\n For the entire thing.\n\n1:22:51.860 --> 1:22:52.860\n You're so accurate.\n\n1:22:52.860 --> 1:22:53.860\n Okay.\n\n1:22:53.860 --> 1:22:54.860\n Great.\n\n1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:56.420\n Your representation of me is just fantastic.\n\n1:22:56.420 --> 1:23:02.500\n The combat arms unit of Afghanistan, the ice cream machine.\n\n1:23:02.500 --> 1:23:07.580\n What like when you actually get closer and closer to the mission, what, when does that\n\n1:23:07.580 --> 1:23:08.580\n happen?\n\n1:23:08.580 --> 1:23:12.220\n When I, you know, got to where we were before we were leaving to get on the plane, I don't\n\n1:23:12.220 --> 1:23:15.540\n really, I don't think I realized what the hell I was doing.\n\n1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:19.300\n Truthfully, like you're asking me all these, like, what did you feel, how did you, like\n\n1:23:19.300 --> 1:23:24.620\n when I really think about it, if I sit there and really think about it, I was deploying.\n\n1:23:24.620 --> 1:23:25.620\n I was aware.\n\n1:23:25.620 --> 1:23:26.740\n I knew what I was going to do.\n\n1:23:26.740 --> 1:23:32.740\n I knew my job, but once we actually stepped onto that Herc to leave, to get into the Afghan\n\n1:23:32.740 --> 1:23:35.060\n airspace, I think that's when it hit me.\n\n1:23:35.060 --> 1:23:38.260\n I think it smacked me in the face so hard.\n\n1:23:38.260 --> 1:23:48.660\n And that's when the overwhelming just reality was that, oh fuck, oh, oh, oh.\n\n1:23:48.660 --> 1:23:55.260\n When they said, make weapons ready, put the barrel to the ground, put your helmets on.\n\n1:23:55.260 --> 1:23:58.140\n That's when they start flying tactically, which means they're going between the mountains.\n\n1:23:58.140 --> 1:23:59.640\n That means we're going to land soon.\n\n1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:04.500\n Which means if you're flying like this, it's because RPGs can hit you.\n\n1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:08.820\n So that was my first moment of, oh, I could like just be shot down right now.\n\n1:24:08.820 --> 1:24:11.660\n Like I, I couldn't, I didn't grasp it.\n\n1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:13.620\n I was, how old was I?\n\n1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:14.620\n 19.\n\n1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:15.620\n 19.\n\n1:24:15.620 --> 1:24:16.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:16.620 --> 1:24:17.620\n Wow.\n\n1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:18.620\n Okay.\n\n1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:21.540\n So I'm trying to explain to you cause it's hard because I don't know that I actually\n\n1:24:21.540 --> 1:24:26.140\n did grasp it until I was in the air getting ready to land in Kandahar.\n\n1:24:26.140 --> 1:24:33.300\n When was the first time you heard bullets, enemy, enemy bullets or enemy explosions?\n\n1:24:33.300 --> 1:24:37.540\n Well, when you're in Kandahar, when you're in Kandahar, when you're at CAF, there's a,\n\n1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:39.660\n you're fairly insulated away from the main walls.\n\n1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:43.900\n You would hear stuff go off or you would hear the rocket sirens would go off.\n\n1:24:43.900 --> 1:24:48.340\n So you would hear the, and everyone just kind of got down on the ground and just waited\n\n1:24:48.340 --> 1:24:49.340\n for the all clear.\n\n1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:50.820\n And then we got back up.\n\n1:24:50.820 --> 1:24:58.160\n I didn't hear any actual live fire until I got to the FOB.\n\n1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:00.340\n It was more just a lot of noise.\n\n1:25:00.340 --> 1:25:04.260\n You would hear a lot of helicopters, a lot of planes going in and out of the base.\n\n1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:07.380\n So there was that sense you could feel the ground shake when they took off, but there\n\n1:25:07.380 --> 1:25:10.300\n was that sense, you know, things were going around, things were happening.\n\n1:25:10.300 --> 1:25:12.620\n You just weren't far enough.\n\n1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:17.060\n You were not close enough to the edges of CAF to see it.\n\n1:25:17.060 --> 1:25:19.180\n So what's the FOB?\n\n1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:25.140\n FOB is a Forward Observation Base, which is a small little base out in the middle of wherever.\n\n1:25:25.140 --> 1:25:28.260\n And that's, that's specific to artillery?\n\n1:25:28.260 --> 1:25:29.260\n No.\n\n1:25:29.260 --> 1:25:32.540\n That's in general, just an observation base from which combat.\n\n1:25:32.540 --> 1:25:36.580\n For infantry to go in and out of, for armor to go in and out of, special ops go in and\n\n1:25:36.580 --> 1:25:37.580\n out of them.\n\n1:25:37.580 --> 1:25:38.660\n They fly, they'll stop there.\n\n1:25:38.660 --> 1:25:41.140\n They'll pick people up or do whatever, then they'll go out.\n\n1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:45.960\n So it's, a Forward Observation Base is used essentially to have eyes in that area without\n\n1:25:45.960 --> 1:25:48.260\n having to be doing patrols every five seconds.\n\n1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:50.500\n But there's not, is it like, is there like medics there?\n\n1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:51.500\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:52.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:52.500 --> 1:25:53.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:53.500 --> 1:25:54.500\n So it was.\n\n1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:55.500\n Actual base?\n\n1:25:55.500 --> 1:25:56.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:56.500 --> 1:25:57.500\n I was, it's a, I don't call it an actual base.\n\n1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:58.500\n You sleep in tents and cots.\n\n1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:03.100\n And it is, the walls are this mesh material that are filled with gravel.\n\n1:26:03.100 --> 1:26:05.500\n And that's the walls.\n\n1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:06.500\n And then you have towers.\n\n1:26:06.500 --> 1:26:10.860\n You had five, I think we had five towers because the Americans ran four and we ran one.\n\n1:26:10.860 --> 1:26:12.380\n And so it was an American FOB.\n\n1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:14.780\n It's called FOB Ramrod.\n\n1:26:14.780 --> 1:26:17.780\n And there was a, were there Marines?\n\n1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:20.380\n No, I think they were the 101st.\n\n1:26:20.380 --> 1:26:22.020\n They were out of there.\n\n1:26:22.020 --> 1:26:24.620\n This is where I get dicey because I was moved a lot.\n\n1:26:24.620 --> 1:26:25.980\n So when people are like, who are you with?\n\n1:26:25.980 --> 1:26:28.820\n I'm like, I know what their patches looked like.\n\n1:26:28.820 --> 1:26:30.940\n I don't know the full ins and outs.\n\n1:26:30.940 --> 1:26:34.140\n So I'm working on getting that back so that I can tell it accurately because I believe\n\n1:26:34.140 --> 1:26:35.820\n it deserves that type of respect.\n\n1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:40.020\n But that being said, I'm still trying to wrap my brain around all of this.\n\n1:26:40.020 --> 1:26:41.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:41.020 --> 1:26:46.740\n You almost have to go back and do like research to understand the full details of all the\n\n1:26:46.740 --> 1:26:47.980\n things you were experiencing.\n\n1:26:47.980 --> 1:26:50.860\n And so I reached out to actually a bunch of people even before I wrote the book and I\n\n1:26:50.860 --> 1:26:51.860\n didn't get a lot of answers.\n\n1:26:51.860 --> 1:26:55.380\n Well, once I did Jocko, all the people have reached out to me and were like, hey, and\n\n1:26:55.380 --> 1:26:56.740\n I'm like, called you.\n\n1:26:56.740 --> 1:27:00.420\n So now I'm working, that's why I'm doing the rewrite is I'm working on making sure that\n\n1:27:00.420 --> 1:27:02.780\n things are exact.\n\n1:27:02.780 --> 1:27:08.380\n And so there was infantry units going in at that FOB and it was a really tiny FOB.\n\n1:27:08.380 --> 1:27:14.220\n It was run by the Americans and then there was a tiny little corner that was the Canadian\n\n1:27:14.220 --> 1:27:15.980\n artillery unit.\n\n1:27:15.980 --> 1:27:20.180\n And the Americans, normally it's Americans shooting for Americans, Canadians shooting\n\n1:27:20.180 --> 1:27:21.180\n for Canadians.\n\n1:27:21.180 --> 1:27:26.180\n The rest of the regiment that deployed, so Bravo and Charlie, they were at Canadian FOBs,\n\n1:27:26.180 --> 1:27:29.280\n Massom Guard and another one and these were huge FOBs.\n\n1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:35.980\n Ours was this tiny like three kilometer around place and we had this tiny little subsection\n\n1:27:35.980 --> 1:27:40.340\n of it and the rest was so it was like this and then all American here.\n\n1:27:40.340 --> 1:27:44.380\n And when we got there, we landed, the guns were already there.\n\n1:27:44.380 --> 1:27:46.180\n So you ripped out the unit before you.\n\n1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:49.380\n So those guys were just leaving and we were just replacing them.\n\n1:27:49.380 --> 1:27:53.300\n So that we knew the guns, they were Canadian guns, we understood, you know, how to run\n\n1:27:53.300 --> 1:27:54.300\n those.\n\n1:27:54.300 --> 1:27:55.300\n That was fine.\n\n1:27:55.300 --> 1:28:01.860\n When we got there, though, we had come in on Chinook and Chinooks are super loud and\n\n1:28:01.860 --> 1:28:03.140\n they're like, we're hearing protection.\n\n1:28:03.140 --> 1:28:07.100\n They don't, you're not, no, this is not reality.\n\n1:28:07.100 --> 1:28:08.660\n Like this is why I'm partially deaf now.\n\n1:28:08.660 --> 1:28:09.660\n Like it's not reality.\n\n1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:15.920\n So sorry to take a tangent, but do you usually wear ear protection in any aspects of warfare\n\n1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:17.500\n of this whole process?\n\n1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:23.060\n You wear comms, like you have a comm on like in a radio if you're outside the wire.\n\n1:28:23.060 --> 1:28:24.900\n So comms, is that like a Bluetooth headset?\n\n1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:26.740\n Yes, it's a Bluetooth headset.\n\n1:28:26.740 --> 1:28:27.740\n Okay.\n\n1:28:27.740 --> 1:28:28.740\n No.\n\n1:28:28.740 --> 1:28:29.740\n Like from Nike or like?\n\n1:28:29.740 --> 1:28:30.740\n I was gonna say Adidas.\n\n1:28:30.740 --> 1:28:31.740\n Okay.\n\n1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:33.300\n I don't know if anyone was involved at some point.\n\n1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:34.300\n I don't know.\n\n1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:35.860\n This equipment looked like it was from World War II.\n\n1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:39.060\n So it's comms, but is that having ear protection?\n\n1:28:39.060 --> 1:28:40.060\n Like.\n\n1:28:40.060 --> 1:28:41.060\n No.\n\n1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:42.060\n No.\n\n1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:43.060\n And I didn't wear them.\n\n1:28:43.060 --> 1:28:44.060\n That's just what some people wore.\n\n1:28:44.060 --> 1:28:46.860\n People when you were as low as me, like we weren't privy to conversate.\n\n1:28:46.860 --> 1:28:48.980\n Like we were just told what to do and you do it.\n\n1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:53.060\n So when you're doing like on the OP tower, you have a radio, you pick up and you call\n\n1:28:53.060 --> 1:28:54.420\n in and then you put the radio down.\n\n1:28:54.420 --> 1:28:59.560\n But for hearing protection, I mean, I would put in earplugs, but those things are so violently\n\n1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:02.620\n loud that earplugs, they don't do it justice.\n\n1:29:02.620 --> 1:29:09.540\n I feel like when you go shooting, there's a certain kinds of earplugs that you, it blocks\n\n1:29:09.540 --> 1:29:14.420\n out the gut, like certain kinds of sounds associated with guns and you can still hear\n\n1:29:14.420 --> 1:29:16.060\n other types of stuff.\n\n1:29:16.060 --> 1:29:20.780\n So the ones they issued us were these big things that had like a headpiece like here,\n\n1:29:20.780 --> 1:29:22.900\n but you have to wear your helmet when you're firing.\n\n1:29:22.900 --> 1:29:23.900\n Right.\n\n1:29:23.900 --> 1:29:25.380\n So you can't have both on.\n\n1:29:25.380 --> 1:29:26.380\n Okay.\n\n1:29:26.380 --> 1:29:29.260\n So how much are you aware of the logistics of the whole thing?\n\n1:29:29.260 --> 1:29:31.900\n That's always fascinating with warfare.\n\n1:29:31.900 --> 1:29:36.980\n Like in terms of setting up, you mentioned gravel and the fobs, like setting all those\n\n1:29:36.980 --> 1:29:37.980\n bases out.\n\n1:29:37.980 --> 1:29:41.980\n Were you seeing any of this or again, it's a 19 year old kind of just.\n\n1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:43.580\n Well, it's not that I was oblivious.\n\n1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:44.940\n That's the one thing I would say I wasn't.\n\n1:29:44.940 --> 1:29:47.140\n I was, I'm very aware of my surroundings.\n\n1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:50.460\n That's something that's always been taught to me from a very early age because I travel\n\n1:29:50.460 --> 1:29:52.100\n a lot with my dad in the truck.\n\n1:29:52.100 --> 1:29:54.660\n And so my dad would be like, you're going to go into that bathroom and I'm going to\n\n1:29:54.660 --> 1:29:58.940\n watch you come out and you're going to watch everyone around you because people get kidnapped.\n\n1:29:58.940 --> 1:30:00.460\n Like that's just the reality.\n\n1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:03.280\n I was always very paranoid.\n\n1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:07.020\n So you were paying attention to surroundings.\n\n1:30:07.020 --> 1:30:09.620\n But the fob was already built up when we got there.\n\n1:30:09.620 --> 1:30:12.100\n This is already like well established bases already.\n\n1:30:12.100 --> 1:30:13.100\n Like there's.\n\n1:30:13.100 --> 1:30:14.100\n Established enough.\n\n1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:15.780\n All right.\n\n1:30:15.780 --> 1:30:19.940\n And that is one of the first times you've heard actual fire.\n\n1:30:19.940 --> 1:30:20.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:20.940 --> 1:30:24.620\n That was like the, I mean, I'd heard it on the, when we, when we shoot and when we zero\n\n1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:26.100\n in weapons and we do all that stuff.\n\n1:30:26.100 --> 1:30:29.940\n But I had never heard it, heard it like that before.\n\n1:30:29.940 --> 1:30:33.700\n And then you would see the, the, the guys, the Americans would roll out every day and\n\n1:30:33.700 --> 1:30:36.020\n go on patrol and come back, back, back.\n\n1:30:36.020 --> 1:30:40.020\n And so you would see them, you would hear them, they would tell the stories, those types\n\n1:30:40.020 --> 1:30:41.060\n of things.\n\n1:30:41.060 --> 1:30:45.100\n But I never experienced it because we never, we never got attacked.\n\n1:30:45.100 --> 1:30:46.420\n Like our base never got hit.\n\n1:30:46.420 --> 1:30:48.700\n We were really lucky that way.\n\n1:30:48.700 --> 1:30:51.700\n There were other ones around us that were getting hit, but we weren't, we weren't getting\n\n1:30:51.700 --> 1:30:52.700\n hit.\n\n1:30:52.700 --> 1:30:54.740\n We were very fortunate.\n\n1:30:54.740 --> 1:30:56.300\n At least we didn't get hit when I was there.\n\n1:30:56.300 --> 1:31:00.540\n I believe the entry got, there was an attempt.\n\n1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:04.620\n There was an attempt at some point in a past, but I wasn't privy to that.\n\n1:31:04.620 --> 1:31:08.160\n But we were in the OP tower, so we had to do our own security.\n\n1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:12.020\n But because we were such a small subset of Canadians and we always had to have people\n\n1:31:12.020 --> 1:31:14.740\n running the guns and ready to run the guns at all times.\n\n1:31:14.740 --> 1:31:16.180\n We only had to man one tower.\n\n1:31:16.180 --> 1:31:20.700\n So you would do four hour shifts with a fire team partner in the tower, depending on whatever,\n\n1:31:20.700 --> 1:31:22.200\n but you would do it every day.\n\n1:31:22.200 --> 1:31:26.980\n So I would look out into the rest of Afghanistan at that opportunity.\n\n1:31:26.980 --> 1:31:28.300\n Otherwise it was just like your walls.\n\n1:31:28.300 --> 1:31:29.700\n What did it look like?\n\n1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:31.100\n Is it beautiful?\n\n1:31:31.100 --> 1:31:33.020\n Just the full landscape?\n\n1:31:33.020 --> 1:31:34.020\n Or is it?\n\n1:31:34.020 --> 1:31:36.540\n Where I was, there was mountains in the distance.\n\n1:31:36.540 --> 1:31:39.520\n It was just very sandy, very flat.\n\n1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:41.900\n And there was a couple of small compounds on the outside.\n\n1:31:41.900 --> 1:31:43.760\n It wasn't a lot to look at.\n\n1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:47.140\n There was a long road that you knew that got hit all the time.\n\n1:31:47.140 --> 1:31:49.900\n There wasn't a lot to look at.\n\n1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:56.020\n Such a strange place to be the center of superpowers over the decades.\n\n1:31:56.020 --> 1:31:58.860\n It really is.\n\n1:31:58.860 --> 1:32:03.340\n And the fact that the populace, the civilians are almost completely clueless to the full\n\n1:32:03.340 --> 1:32:07.980\n history of things in terms of globally, the geopolitics of it all.\n\n1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:08.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:08.980 --> 1:32:12.180\n Well, if you look at the location of it, right, on a map, it makes more sense.\n\n1:32:12.180 --> 1:32:13.180\n Right.\n\n1:32:13.180 --> 1:32:15.420\n You can wrap your brain around it.\n\n1:32:15.420 --> 1:32:18.500\n But I met plenty of people who had never even seen a picture of themselves when I was in\n\n1:32:18.500 --> 1:32:19.500\n that country.\n\n1:32:19.500 --> 1:32:24.740\n I mean, how much more are they going to understand if they don't know what even exists outside?\n\n1:32:24.740 --> 1:32:31.580\n You tell a small story of taking a picture of a girl and showing it to her, an Afghani\n\n1:32:31.580 --> 1:32:32.580\n girl.\n\n1:32:32.580 --> 1:32:33.580\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:33.580 --> 1:32:38.180\n We were, I was with the British at that time, and we were on that operation that gets highlighted\n\n1:32:38.180 --> 1:32:39.580\n quite a bit.\n\n1:32:39.580 --> 1:32:42.740\n And we had stopped and the ICOM radios were pinging.\n\n1:32:42.740 --> 1:32:49.980\n And ICOM radios are a radio that we have an interpreter on that the Taliban, basically\n\n1:32:49.980 --> 1:32:51.420\n we can hear what they're saying.\n\n1:32:51.420 --> 1:32:52.420\n It's their comms.\n\n1:32:52.420 --> 1:32:53.420\n It's us tapped in.\n\n1:32:53.420 --> 1:32:56.160\n When it's really clear, they're close.\n\n1:32:56.160 --> 1:33:02.460\n When it's scatty and they're far enough away, normally they're not planning an attack, although\n\n1:33:02.460 --> 1:33:04.140\n you never know, really.\n\n1:33:04.140 --> 1:33:09.300\n And we were going door to door, kind of like what they're doing now.\n\n1:33:09.300 --> 1:33:11.140\n And we were pulling people out of their houses.\n\n1:33:11.140 --> 1:33:14.500\n And we knew there were, there was people in there that were active Taliban and we knew\n\n1:33:14.500 --> 1:33:15.500\n the ICOMs were pinging.\n\n1:33:15.500 --> 1:33:18.900\n When we got in there, they had hidden all the women and kids and locked them inside\n\n1:33:18.900 --> 1:33:24.580\n the house because often nowadays women, the women, they would hide things on them that\n\n1:33:24.580 --> 1:33:28.020\n they shouldn't have because no one would be ever there to search them because there isn't\n\n1:33:28.020 --> 1:33:30.300\n a lot of women on the front lines.\n\n1:33:30.300 --> 1:33:33.540\n But I got borrowed to go specifically search women and children.\n\n1:33:33.540 --> 1:33:38.460\n So they had me and one of the little girls kind of snuck out and was kind of sitting\n\n1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:43.620\n near me and I was eating something and I had these little candies, I think they're called\n\n1:33:43.620 --> 1:33:44.620\n little sweeties.\n\n1:33:44.620 --> 1:33:46.020\n The British have them in the ration packs.\n\n1:33:46.020 --> 1:33:47.020\n I don't know.\n\n1:33:47.020 --> 1:33:48.020\n They're good though.\n\n1:33:48.020 --> 1:33:51.740\n And she saw me eating them and so I gave them to her and then her brother came over and\n\n1:33:51.740 --> 1:33:53.900\n slapped her upside the head and took them from her.\n\n1:33:53.900 --> 1:33:56.700\n So then I just went over and slapped him upside the head and just pointed my gun at her while\n\n1:33:56.700 --> 1:34:01.060\n she ate them all because I was like, no, you can have these.\n\n1:34:01.060 --> 1:34:03.900\n I'm going to stand here and make sure you do.\n\n1:34:03.900 --> 1:34:06.740\n And I remember asking, can I take a picture with her?\n\n1:34:06.740 --> 1:34:10.620\n I asked the trip, can you ask her, can I take a picture with her?\n\n1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:14.420\n And she was very confused and when you look at the photo, you see her face, she's very\n\n1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:15.420\n stunned.\n\n1:34:15.420 --> 1:34:16.420\n She's very stunned.\n\n1:34:16.420 --> 1:34:17.580\n And it wasn't my camera.\n\n1:34:17.580 --> 1:34:18.580\n It was my officer's camera.\n\n1:34:18.580 --> 1:34:22.260\n It was a hot pink, like fluorescent pink camera.\n\n1:34:22.260 --> 1:34:27.400\n So I pulled this like a huge pink thing and I'm like, let's take a picture.\n\n1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.340\n And so she stood there and took a picture, but then she grabbed the camera because I\n\n1:34:30.340 --> 1:34:36.100\n flipped it and showed it to her and her eyes got huge and she grabbed it and she ran inside\n\n1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:37.780\n and they're like, oh, that's gone forever.\n\n1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:40.100\n Like that's, it's over for you.\n\n1:34:40.100 --> 1:34:44.820\n And then she came out and she kind of snuck out and I went in and grabbed it and the mom\n\n1:34:44.820 --> 1:34:50.340\n lifted up her burqa and was showing me that she like shaved her legs to be more Western.\n\n1:34:50.340 --> 1:35:00.260\n And I was just, at that moment, I don't know that I could have realized how much that moment\n\n1:35:00.260 --> 1:35:08.220\n affected me, how much that moment would affect me later on in my life until it's been later\n\n1:35:08.220 --> 1:35:09.220\n on in my life.\n\n1:35:09.220 --> 1:35:10.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:35:10.220 --> 1:35:16.880\n There's little like glimmers like that in parts of the world that are basically you're\n\n1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:21.820\n taking away everything from the populace, like freedoms and so on.\n\n1:35:21.820 --> 1:35:29.620\n And when they, when you see that glimmer of humanity, like yeah, shaved legs or like using\n\n1:35:29.620 --> 1:35:34.780\n technology for the first time, it's magic or like food being presented with certain\n\n1:35:34.780 --> 1:35:36.700\n kinds of foods that you've never tried.\n\n1:35:36.700 --> 1:35:45.220\n I mean, you want to see true, like joy of discovery is you bring basically the American\n\n1:35:45.220 --> 1:35:49.060\n supermarket, anything from it to most parts of the world.\n\n1:35:49.060 --> 1:35:55.340\n And they, I just, I mean, I remember even, I mean, we weren't like in poverty in Russia,\n\n1:35:55.340 --> 1:35:58.420\n just poor, but just the supermarket was full of joy.\n\n1:35:58.420 --> 1:36:02.960\n I thought I could just die happy in an American supermarket when I first saw it.\n\n1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:04.820\n And how old were you when you came here?\n\n1:36:04.820 --> 1:36:05.820\n 13.\n\n1:36:05.820 --> 1:36:06.820\n Did you speak English?\n\n1:36:06.820 --> 1:36:07.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:07.820 --> 1:36:11.420\n Not well, I thought I was, I never was good at languages.\n\n1:36:11.420 --> 1:36:16.500\n So I, it was very much like why would I need to learn another language?\n\n1:36:16.500 --> 1:36:17.500\n Okay.\n\n1:36:17.500 --> 1:36:24.900\n It was that attitude is very like, doesn't, I don't, well, no, I think culturally in,\n\n1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:30.420\n not only in America, but everywhere else in the world, it's constantly kind of seen, it's\n\n1:36:30.420 --> 1:36:35.500\n a good thing to do to learn other languages, especially English, because it's like, that's\n\n1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:37.620\n the language of the world.\n\n1:36:37.620 --> 1:36:43.100\n And I just thought like, I don't need English to discover the beauty of the world.\n\n1:36:43.100 --> 1:36:45.140\n Like this doesn't like, I enjoy life.\n\n1:36:45.140 --> 1:36:46.340\n I enjoy soccer.\n\n1:36:46.340 --> 1:36:52.220\n I enjoy, I don't remember what else I enjoyed in life, but math, like why do I need English\n\n1:36:52.220 --> 1:36:53.220\n for this?\n\n1:36:53.220 --> 1:36:57.860\n So that kind of attitude got me in a lot of trouble when I came here because I couldn't.\n\n1:36:57.860 --> 1:36:59.300\n You were reluctant?\n\n1:36:59.300 --> 1:37:00.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:00.300 --> 1:37:01.300\n But also just couldn't speak well.\n\n1:37:01.300 --> 1:37:05.820\n And when you move 13 years old, it's middle school, you get made fun of a lot.\n\n1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:10.260\n You get bullied and all those kinds of things, which in retrospect is a very positive thing\n\n1:37:10.260 --> 1:37:13.420\n because it makes you harder.\n\n1:37:13.420 --> 1:37:16.220\n I thought being Russian would be like hard enough.\n\n1:37:16.220 --> 1:37:18.660\n No, well, me, everyone is different.\n\n1:37:18.660 --> 1:37:26.780\n I mean, the part of the Russian thing is kind of, I'm joking because if you know me, I admire\n\n1:37:26.780 --> 1:37:27.780\n being hard.\n\n1:37:27.780 --> 1:37:33.780\n I admire fighting and these kinds of things, these, what would you call them?\n\n1:37:33.780 --> 1:37:37.060\n Struggle in all of its forms, martial arts, wrestling, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:37:37.060 --> 1:37:39.980\n But I'm ultimately like, I'm so much about love.\n\n1:37:39.980 --> 1:37:46.380\n Like I'm clearly sensitive to the world in some weird genetic way that it was important\n\n1:37:46.380 --> 1:37:52.500\n for me to harden up when I came here and I was in love with people and everybody's being\n\n1:37:52.500 --> 1:37:53.500\n mean to me.\n\n1:37:53.500 --> 1:38:03.020\n And it's like, what, that, it's a little like slap, like, oh, okay, life is not often fair.\n\n1:38:03.020 --> 1:38:07.660\n And then that's when for me personally, everybody has different journeys of hardship that are\n\n1:38:07.660 --> 1:38:12.860\n much, much more difficult, like your story is much more difficult.\n\n1:38:12.860 --> 1:38:15.480\n I started to read a lot.\n\n1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:18.380\n Something happens, some kind of challenge where you start to think about the world,\n\n1:38:18.380 --> 1:38:24.740\n start to think about yourself, that can ultimately create really interesting minds.\n\n1:38:24.740 --> 1:38:25.980\n It can break some people.\n\n1:38:25.980 --> 1:38:27.860\n It can create interesting minds.\n\n1:38:27.860 --> 1:38:28.860\n And it's ultimately your choice.\n\n1:38:28.860 --> 1:38:30.940\n But those people are weak and then they just need to be weeded out.\n\n1:38:30.940 --> 1:38:34.260\n I thought we talked about this, you know, the strong will survive, the weak will die\n\n1:38:34.260 --> 1:38:35.260\n off.\n\n1:38:35.260 --> 1:38:36.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:36.260 --> 1:38:38.620\n Now you're talking Russian to me.\n\n1:38:38.620 --> 1:38:39.860\n I'm not speaking Russian.\n\n1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:43.860\n I'm just giving solid life advice.\n\n1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:46.780\n Just be harder and then everyone will be fine.\n\n1:38:46.780 --> 1:38:47.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:47.780 --> 1:38:50.340\n That's your inner David Goggins coming out real quick here.\n\n1:38:50.340 --> 1:38:51.340\n Okay.\n\n1:38:51.340 --> 1:38:52.340\n The fob.\n\n1:38:52.340 --> 1:38:53.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:53.340 --> 1:38:57.340\n And then I was just explaining to you that the way it is run, you're going to love this.\n\n1:38:57.340 --> 1:39:01.860\n When we walked up to those tents for the first time, the people that were there before us\n\n1:39:01.860 --> 1:39:05.100\n left us a noose.\n\n1:39:05.100 --> 1:39:10.300\n I have a photo of it, like hanging from the tent, like at the front of the tent, like\n\n1:39:10.300 --> 1:39:11.820\n welcome.\n\n1:39:11.820 --> 1:39:17.500\n So you were also mentioning like the dark humor of it is a basically a funny joke.\n\n1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:18.500\n Correct.\n\n1:39:18.500 --> 1:39:19.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:20.500\n It was funny at first.\n\n1:39:20.500 --> 1:39:21.500\n That's pretty funny.\n\n1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:22.660\n It was funny during the time.\n\n1:39:22.660 --> 1:39:26.620\n Now when I look back at it, I was like, come on.\n\n1:39:26.620 --> 1:39:29.900\n I mean, I get it because they had already been there.\n\n1:39:29.900 --> 1:39:34.500\n And like, so afterwards I can see how it's funny.\n\n1:39:34.500 --> 1:39:38.940\n Now with like the suicide epidemic in the veteran community, now I'm like, oh, I don't\n\n1:39:38.940 --> 1:39:39.940\n post that photo.\n\n1:39:39.940 --> 1:39:40.940\n Really?\n\n1:39:40.940 --> 1:39:41.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:41.940 --> 1:39:45.540\n Doesn't that dark humor still somehow help even when you're considering suicide?\n\n1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:46.540\n Doesn't it?\n\n1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:47.540\n Some of it.\n\n1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:48.540\n Somehow.\n\n1:39:48.540 --> 1:39:49.540\n It makes it copable.\n\n1:39:49.540 --> 1:39:50.540\n Somehow.\n\n1:39:50.540 --> 1:39:51.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:51.540 --> 1:39:52.540\n It's like you're not hiding it.\n\n1:39:52.540 --> 1:39:59.980\n It's like humor is one of the ways to reveal the reality of abuse, of suffering.\n\n1:39:59.980 --> 1:40:04.060\n If you look at, there's this photo that generates right around suicide prevention month, which\n\n1:40:04.060 --> 1:40:05.900\n is September.\n\n1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:10.140\n And it's always like a photo of like Robin Williams and Bourdain and all of these other\n\n1:40:10.140 --> 1:40:15.540\n individuals who were comedians who all took their lives and they're all smiling.\n\n1:40:15.540 --> 1:40:19.100\n And they're like, this is the face of depression.\n\n1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:26.460\n There's a way our brains work where humor is a necessary part of survival, whether it's\n\n1:40:26.460 --> 1:40:31.760\n used for joyous things or it's used for ways to cope through life.\n\n1:40:31.760 --> 1:40:35.220\n For me in the military, humor was one of the things that helped get me through.\n\n1:40:35.220 --> 1:40:43.540\n And it still does to this day, frankly, because humor, humor makes some of the horrific things\n\n1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:47.100\n I say not seem so horrific.\n\n1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:53.060\n And people can digest it rather than being like, you need to be locked up somewhere.\n\n1:40:53.060 --> 1:40:54.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:54.060 --> 1:41:01.620\n That's why, I mean, one of the aspects of Russian humor, there's a darkness to it because\n\n1:41:01.620 --> 1:41:06.340\n through it reverberates all the millions of people who died.\n\n1:41:06.340 --> 1:41:10.340\n And it seems like the only way to make sense of it is to joke about it.\n\n1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:11.340\n I still love it.\n\n1:41:11.340 --> 1:41:13.740\n Because if you don't, it'll break you.\n\n1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:14.740\n Something like that.\n\n1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:22.100\n Or also humor just seems to be the highest form of us humans and the human experience.\n\n1:41:22.100 --> 1:41:28.600\n It just seems, it seems to somehow accumulate the full thing, the absurdity of it, the unfairness\n\n1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:35.060\n of it, because like ultimately all the suffering is like, it's all just apes fighting for power\n\n1:41:35.060 --> 1:41:40.020\n and love and somehow torturing each other in the process.\n\n1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:42.700\n Hello podcast listener, Lex here.\n\n1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:46.660\n Quick intermission to say that some of the names in the following story have been silenced\n\n1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:49.940\n out to protect their privacy.\n\n1:41:49.940 --> 1:42:01.540\n The story of, and witnessing, I think your first, somebody you met, somebody you saw,\n\n1:42:01.540 --> 1:42:12.220\n somebody you began to be close with, his life, him dying, can you tell the story of him dying?\n\n1:42:12.220 --> 1:42:13.220\n Sure.\n\n1:42:13.220 --> 1:42:14.540\n That's no problem.\n\n1:42:14.540 --> 1:42:20.940\n I will tell you that I am going to leave some of the names out of the people because they\n\n1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:24.020\n have reached out and asked that I do such.\n\n1:42:24.020 --> 1:42:28.360\n I've also been informed of other things I forgot that happened during the thing that\n\n1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:30.140\n were way worse than I thought.\n\n1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:34.660\n So I'll try to add those in because that's new information to me because my brain has\n\n1:42:34.660 --> 1:42:35.660\n blocked it out.\n\n1:42:35.660 --> 1:42:39.740\n But I've been told, which is good because it's better detail.\n\n1:42:39.740 --> 1:42:47.020\n So we were doing a movement that morning and we were going from compound to compound.\n\n1:42:47.020 --> 1:42:49.740\n I was never told what we were doing.\n\n1:42:49.740 --> 1:42:51.180\n I knew what my job was.\n\n1:42:51.180 --> 1:42:53.500\n I didn't know the operational overview.\n\n1:42:53.500 --> 1:42:56.900\n I didn't know who we were looking for.\n\n1:42:56.900 --> 1:42:58.060\n I wasn't there for that.\n\n1:42:58.060 --> 1:43:03.320\n My job was specifically to look after the women and children and to provide support\n\n1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:05.040\n if need be.\n\n1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:11.460\n And when you have certain people, so i.e. the bomb dog handler and the bomb dog, and\n\n1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:16.700\n then you have the medics and then you have a female searcher, there's only one of those\n\n1:43:16.700 --> 1:43:20.020\n in each unit or if there's even one in each unit.\n\n1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:26.160\n I got passed between units so that they could have access to me for both.\n\n1:43:26.160 --> 1:43:30.480\n And we were kind of sitting and we were waiting for the all clear to move.\n\n1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:37.740\n And at that time, the compound wall I was leaning up against, I had my back up against.\n\n1:43:37.740 --> 1:43:42.180\n I wasn't facing the direct direction where it actually blew up.\n\n1:43:42.180 --> 1:43:46.940\n I had my back to it and I had happened to turn and look to the left.\n\n1:43:46.940 --> 1:43:52.080\n And on the right hand side across the road of where we were leaned up against was another\n\n1:43:52.080 --> 1:43:59.740\n compound two stories high, people inside, a sniper on the roof and a spotter.\n\n1:43:59.740 --> 1:44:07.660\n There was a handful of us on this wall and in front of me, there was a road.\n\n1:44:07.660 --> 1:44:09.580\n The road went straight.\n\n1:44:09.580 --> 1:44:10.580\n That compounds here.\n\n1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:13.380\n There's another road here on the right hand side in front of it.\n\n1:44:13.380 --> 1:44:17.660\n And then this road went along here and this was a wide open space.\n\n1:44:17.660 --> 1:44:20.160\n Just a huge.\n\n1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:21.220\n We hate those.\n\n1:44:21.220 --> 1:44:23.800\n You hate those because it's too much space.\n\n1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:24.800\n It's too easy.\n\n1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:26.440\n It's like fish in a barrel.\n\n1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:29.720\n You don't want to be in that field.\n\n1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:32.820\n Because there's too much line of sight line of sight.\n\n1:44:32.820 --> 1:44:33.820\n Could be IEDs.\n\n1:44:33.820 --> 1:44:34.820\n It could be.\n\n1:44:34.820 --> 1:44:35.820\n It could be.\n\n1:44:35.820 --> 1:44:36.820\n It could be anything.\n\n1:44:36.820 --> 1:44:45.900\n And so when I was leaning up against the wall, we had sent a couple of people ahead to go\n\n1:44:45.900 --> 1:44:50.420\n and clear the road so that we could all go along it and then clear the gray pup off to\n\n1:44:50.420 --> 1:44:52.460\n the left hand side.\n\n1:44:52.460 --> 1:44:57.900\n We are doing that because they use those locations to put IEDs so that when you're going to search\n\n1:44:57.900 --> 1:45:03.140\n it, it's just it's a better chance of you blowing into a million pieces, essentially\n\n1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:04.660\n why they love that.\n\n1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:07.460\n Put bombs in small places, send people into small places.\n\n1:45:07.460 --> 1:45:10.580\n Small places go boom, they paint the walls.\n\n1:45:10.580 --> 1:45:13.580\n So we were just kind of sitting and waiting.\n\n1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:17.880\n And then I turned, I happened to turn, I was looking in that direction and I heard the\n\n1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:22.380\n ground shake before I even realized what I was seeing with my own eyes.\n\n1:45:22.380 --> 1:45:33.100\n The ground shook and I saw a big piece of a body, I think it was the torso, just kind\n\n1:45:33.100 --> 1:45:37.820\n of fly through the air and land into the field.\n\n1:45:37.820 --> 1:45:40.860\n And as soon as that happened, all hell broke loose.\n\n1:45:40.860 --> 1:45:44.960\n It was like the, they were sitting and watching and waiting and they do that.\n\n1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:47.020\n And I say they, I mean the Taliban, they do that.\n\n1:45:47.020 --> 1:45:51.020\n They love that because then they can record it for propaganda and they can use it against\n\n1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:55.220\n us and they just love being able to take our people out.\n\n1:45:55.220 --> 1:45:59.900\n And we had the interpreter sitting beside me and he had the ICOM radio on.\n\n1:45:59.900 --> 1:46:06.960\n And as soon as the blast went off, I heard just the scream of, I heard it.\n\n1:46:06.960 --> 1:46:13.900\n And I knew what that meant, but I couldn't, I didn't understand what was about to happen.\n\n1:46:13.900 --> 1:46:20.740\n I couldn't, I couldn't wrap my brain around what was about to happen because I had never\n\n1:46:20.740 --> 1:46:23.980\n been outside the wire.\n\n1:46:23.980 --> 1:46:29.240\n And people are like, people say to me now, they're like, no, no, there's no way that\n\n1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:30.240\n shit's true.\n\n1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:33.260\n There's no way that she was involved in that and then that, and then in that, and then\n\n1:46:33.260 --> 1:46:34.260\n in that.\n\n1:46:34.260 --> 1:46:35.540\n Well, let me explain.\n\n1:46:35.540 --> 1:46:37.740\n I was one person.\n\n1:46:37.740 --> 1:46:42.240\n I was being passed around to units.\n\n1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.100\n I was with a ton of different people.\n\n1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:52.700\n I had no comms and I was just being told where to go.\n\n1:46:52.700 --> 1:46:57.940\n And I just happened to be like a shit hit the fan magnet, it felt like.\n\n1:46:57.940 --> 1:47:02.280\n And then I found out later it was not just me, it was all of us were getting it.\n\n1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:05.860\n So that made me feel better because then I was like, well, I have a lot of survivor's\n\n1:47:05.860 --> 1:47:06.860\n guilt.\n\n1:47:06.860 --> 1:47:08.380\n That's like a thing that's still stuck with me.\n\n1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:13.140\n I've worked through a lot of shit, but survivor's guilt, that's a big one for me.\n\n1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:21.260\n And food is a big one for me and my food skin on food.\n\n1:47:21.260 --> 1:47:28.460\n So like chicken with skin on it, just because of the biology of death, just when you hold\n\n1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:33.820\n people's bodies in your hands with no gloves on, you know what that feels like when you\n\n1:47:33.820 --> 1:47:37.220\n touch raw meat again, it's the same thing.\n\n1:47:37.220 --> 1:47:40.340\n That's what that feels like when, when it's a dying or dead body.\n\n1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:45.620\n Well, my friend was blown into a million pieces, so I just had pieces of him.\n\n1:47:45.620 --> 1:47:54.420\n So there was no, there was no differentiator of like, this was his thigh, or this was his\n\n1:47:54.420 --> 1:47:58.500\n torso, or there was like, there was none of that.\n\n1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:07.540\n There's only one instance with the boot, but at that point we had been in some firefights,\n\n1:48:07.540 --> 1:48:13.820\n and we had been taking some rounds, but it was more like take around, you know, get hit\n\n1:48:13.820 --> 1:48:17.260\n and then we duck into a compound and we would set up and then we'd be firing.\n\n1:48:17.260 --> 1:48:21.620\n I wasn't, I wasn't really involved in a lot of the firefights until after this.\n\n1:48:21.620 --> 1:48:25.820\n After that, the rest of the week, I was like, I was angry and I wanted them all to go.\n\n1:48:25.820 --> 1:48:28.600\n And I wanted to be in every position to take them out myself.\n\n1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:30.660\n So I put myself in every position.\n\n1:48:30.660 --> 1:48:31.940\n So I made sure I was on the roof.\n\n1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:33.020\n I made sure I was there.\n\n1:48:33.020 --> 1:48:35.100\n I made sure, Hey, you need something, I'll fucking run it.\n\n1:48:35.100 --> 1:48:38.220\n I don't care if I die anymore, because as soon as that happened, my light switch went\n\n1:48:38.220 --> 1:48:39.220\n off.\n\n1:48:39.220 --> 1:48:40.940\n It didn't matter anymore to me.\n\n1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:42.780\n Can you go through what happens?\n\n1:48:42.780 --> 1:48:43.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:43.780 --> 1:48:46.860\n So are you hearing the, these screams?\n\n1:48:46.860 --> 1:48:47.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:47.860 --> 1:48:54.540\n So the ID went off and what had happened was they put an ID inside of a grape hut and the\n\n1:48:54.540 --> 1:48:58.600\n grape hut has rectangular wall, rectangular holes in the wall.\n\n1:48:58.600 --> 1:49:03.260\n And there's just like one door and it's this tall mud hut with just all these like holes\n\n1:49:03.260 --> 1:49:05.020\n in it.\n\n1:49:05.020 --> 1:49:11.540\n And they had put an ID underneath a pile of sticks and had a metal detector, the Brits\n\n1:49:11.540 --> 1:49:12.540\n carry them.\n\n1:49:12.540 --> 1:49:15.980\n I've never seen, I think other countries have them, but I've only ever seen them use it.\n\n1:49:15.980 --> 1:49:20.820\n And that's how we were kind of detecting if there was an ID, we must've hit it, the sticks\n\n1:49:20.820 --> 1:49:22.700\n or something and it set it off.\n\n1:49:22.700 --> 1:49:24.620\n And it just, it was over.\n\n1:49:24.620 --> 1:49:25.620\n There's no way he felt anything.\n\n1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:30.900\n And then there was another guy at the door bent down on one knee and he was facing and\n\n1:49:30.900 --> 1:49:35.860\n kind of watching for, and then a blast hit him on this side.\n\n1:49:35.860 --> 1:49:38.580\n And so it took him out and pulled his kid off, pulled his helmet off, pulled everything\n\n1:49:38.580 --> 1:49:40.700\n off, fucked him all up.\n\n1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:41.700\n Big time.\n\n1:49:41.700 --> 1:49:43.460\n This is one ID.\n\n1:49:43.460 --> 1:49:44.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:44.460 --> 1:49:50.140\n But it was in a contained area and he was in the doorway, up and out.\n\n1:49:50.140 --> 1:49:54.220\n Can you explain what an ID is and how does it work?\n\n1:49:54.220 --> 1:49:55.660\n I can do my best.\n\n1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:57.380\n They're improvised explosive devices.\n\n1:49:57.380 --> 1:50:00.740\n They can be used pretty much out of anything to make anything.\n\n1:50:00.740 --> 1:50:05.660\n So garbage, when we got to Afghanistan, they did the ID meeting with us.\n\n1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:09.340\n They're like, these are what we're finding that they would show us diffused IDs.\n\n1:50:09.340 --> 1:50:14.220\n So they would see those big blue drums filled with gasoline buried in the ground.\n\n1:50:14.220 --> 1:50:16.980\n You would see a wire, it would go to a pressure plate.\n\n1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:20.620\n You hit the pressure plate, that would hit that and it would go.\n\n1:50:20.620 --> 1:50:21.620\n You would see IDs.\n\n1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:24.380\n Some of them were ridiculous.\n\n1:50:24.380 --> 1:50:29.660\n The engineering that went into some of these was hilarious because they were thinking,\n\n1:50:29.660 --> 1:50:31.900\n they were thinking to use everything they could.\n\n1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:34.680\n There was a cigarette pack they had used.\n\n1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:38.580\n They lined the inside with tinfoil and when you stepped on the tinfoil, it had a piece\n\n1:50:38.580 --> 1:50:42.540\n of wire and it was enough of a spark to set off a line of batteries that we had thrown\n\n1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:43.820\n out that were all dead.\n\n1:50:43.820 --> 1:50:47.220\n When you fuse them all together, there was enough juice to make it go.\n\n1:50:47.220 --> 1:50:51.840\n Then they would attach that to like, like phosphorus or gasoline or whatever they could\n\n1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:53.940\n that would make a big boom.\n\n1:50:53.940 --> 1:50:57.860\n They would use, yeah, that's why you never kick garbage on the ground.\n\n1:50:57.860 --> 1:50:59.940\n You'll never see me kick something on the ground.\n\n1:50:59.940 --> 1:51:01.420\n You'll see me walk around it always.\n\n1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:05.820\n If I ever see a pile of rocks or something that looks like it shouldn't be there, I won't\n\n1:51:05.820 --> 1:51:07.180\n walk near it.\n\n1:51:07.180 --> 1:51:12.140\n Even now, because they use that pile of rocks to remind people there's something there.\n\n1:51:12.140 --> 1:51:14.700\n We don't know what that means, but we know that something's there.\n\n1:51:14.700 --> 1:51:20.100\n And very often they would use anything, garbage, wires.\n\n1:51:20.100 --> 1:51:24.220\n We were very, we had to burn everything for a reason.\n\n1:51:24.220 --> 1:51:32.980\n It's so terrifying to not, for the source of death to be like little parts of the environment\n\n1:51:32.980 --> 1:51:36.940\n and then people that don't look like that.\n\n1:51:36.940 --> 1:51:42.660\n They're not dressed as soldiers, like civilians and like regular, because then you, when you\n\n1:51:42.660 --> 1:51:48.660\n have to come back or even there is you're just surrounded by danger and then you distrust\n\n1:51:48.660 --> 1:51:49.660\n everything essentially.\n\n1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:54.740\n That's the problem and that's why you have such PTSD issues with the soldiers we have\n\n1:51:54.740 --> 1:52:02.300\n now because you're in the environment in which it's very similar.\n\n1:52:02.300 --> 1:52:03.740\n So there's this one IED.\n\n1:52:03.740 --> 1:52:12.380\n So this one IED, I still don't know what it was, went off, body flew, the guy at the door,\n\n1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:13.380\n he kicked out.\n\n1:52:13.380 --> 1:52:19.500\n He was all broken and bleeding and a mess.\n\n1:52:19.500 --> 1:52:21.700\n At that point, the radio started going crazy.\n\n1:52:21.700 --> 1:52:25.580\n I could hear the guys yelling and screaming, trying to figure it out and then you could\n\n1:52:25.580 --> 1:52:27.380\n hear the numbers being called.\n\n1:52:27.380 --> 1:52:29.620\n KIA number, number, number, number.\n\n1:52:29.620 --> 1:52:31.140\n I don't know anybody's service number.\n\n1:52:31.140 --> 1:52:33.740\n I don't know what's going on.\n\n1:52:33.740 --> 1:52:39.020\n Next thing you know, mortar rounds start coming down and live fire starts happening and I'm\n\n1:52:39.020 --> 1:52:42.500\n like, holy fuck, things are popping off.\n\n1:52:42.500 --> 1:52:46.580\n And I remember just looking at and being like, we need to go, we need to go now.\n\n1:52:46.580 --> 1:52:52.020\n And I just got this like, I was like, we're going and they're like, hold on Burns and\n\n1:52:52.020 --> 1:52:53.900\n I'm like, we're fucking going.\n\n1:52:53.900 --> 1:52:58.460\n I wasn't dealing with it well and they're like, all right, all right, go, go, go, go.\n\n1:52:58.460 --> 1:53:08.000\n So we went and I helped out with that other individual, kind of held him down, started\n\n1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:13.820\n doing medic work on him and he just kept saying, where's, where's, where's, he was in such\n\n1:53:13.820 --> 1:53:14.820\n a state of shock.\n\n1:53:14.820 --> 1:53:16.620\n I've seen somebody's eyeballs so big in my life.\n\n1:53:16.620 --> 1:53:21.540\n She's like, where's, where's, where's, he's good buddy, he's good, he's good.\n\n1:53:21.540 --> 1:53:26.420\n Picture like a super thick Scottish accent though, because these guys were just, and\n\n1:53:26.420 --> 1:53:29.140\n when they talk fast, it's even worse.\n\n1:53:29.140 --> 1:53:33.300\n And then so I ran over and we jumped down into the ditch along the side of the road\n\n1:53:33.300 --> 1:53:39.980\n because the road hadn't been cleared and we're running through these tall, they look like\n\n1:53:39.980 --> 1:53:46.580\n cannabis plants, but they're not, but it just very thick bush and I felt like I was running\n\n1:53:46.580 --> 1:53:47.580\n in slow motion.\n\n1:53:47.580 --> 1:53:50.940\n So if you picture one of your video games where like the tunnel vision and you're just,\n\n1:53:50.940 --> 1:53:56.220\n you can hear your breathing is like that and you're running and you can't move fast enough\n\n1:53:56.220 --> 1:54:03.620\n and you're like trying to get there and we hit the road and the rounds are coming down\n\n1:54:03.620 --> 1:54:06.740\n and mortars are coming down and they're like, okay, on three run.\n\n1:54:06.740 --> 1:54:11.620\n So we run on three and we run into the compound, I mean, into the great putt.\n\n1:54:11.620 --> 1:54:17.420\n And I remember looking around and very seriously going, where is he?\n\n1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:23.760\n Just genuinely asking, I think it was been messaging me and he's been incredible.\n\n1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:26.940\n He's one of the best soldiers I've ever served with.\n\n1:54:26.940 --> 1:54:29.980\n He was a higher up, so he was running part of this.\n\n1:54:29.980 --> 1:54:33.920\n He's messaged me and he was giving me some information and he's like, I was in there\n\n1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:38.460\n with you and he goes, I remember cause you handed me the boot and cause I walked over\n\n1:54:38.460 --> 1:54:42.860\n and I, all the rounds were like, we were being shot at, mortars were coming down, but it\n\n1:54:42.860 --> 1:54:50.300\n was this slow motion and I remember walking over to the hole in the ground and seeing\n\n1:54:50.300 --> 1:54:57.820\n his boot in the ground, but it was, his leg was still hanging, like just below his knee\n\n1:54:57.820 --> 1:55:03.860\n was still in it, but the boot was perfectly laced up, like the boot was fine.\n\n1:55:03.860 --> 1:55:09.220\n And I just, I held it and I turned and I looked at the guys and I was like, we could reuse\n\n1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:13.500\n the boot.\n\n1:55:13.500 --> 1:55:17.060\n Now that wasn't even, what is, what is that?\n\n1:55:17.060 --> 1:55:25.460\n Was that, was that actually an intelligent attempt at humor or was it some kind of deeply\n\n1:55:25.460 --> 1:55:26.460\n lost?\n\n1:55:26.460 --> 1:55:27.740\n Like you were completely just lost.\n\n1:55:27.740 --> 1:55:29.940\n I think my brain broke.\n\n1:55:29.940 --> 1:55:35.180\n I think my, that's the moment I call my light switch went off.\n\n1:55:35.180 --> 1:55:37.700\n Did you understand that he was dead at that point?\n\n1:55:37.700 --> 1:55:45.180\n Like intellectually, you were just something, it just broke.\n\n1:55:45.180 --> 1:55:46.180\n No emotion.\n\n1:55:46.180 --> 1:55:47.180\n Like it just broke.\n\n1:55:47.180 --> 1:55:48.180\n It just shattered.\n\n1:55:48.180 --> 1:55:49.180\n It shattered.\n\n1:55:49.180 --> 1:55:50.180\n I felt it happen.\n\n1:55:50.180 --> 1:55:51.180\n Felt.\n\n1:55:51.180 --> 1:56:06.020\n I didn't feel, I didn't feel anything.\n\n1:56:06.020 --> 1:56:08.500\n It just broke.\n\n1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:15.260\n And at that moment, because later there's some anger almost at that moment, none of\n\n1:56:15.260 --> 1:56:16.260\n that.\n\n1:56:16.260 --> 1:56:17.260\n I couldn't comprehend what happened.\n\n1:56:17.260 --> 1:56:23.020\n I knew he wasn't there anymore because they looked at me and said, what's here is here.\n\n1:56:23.020 --> 1:56:24.300\n Start grabbing pieces.\n\n1:56:24.300 --> 1:56:26.420\n We need to fucking move.\n\n1:56:26.420 --> 1:56:32.780\n And so I handed the boot over, they took it and then I started just grabbing anything\n\n1:56:32.780 --> 1:56:38.680\n out of the walls because those little rectangular just had flesh hanging from it.\n\n1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:42.820\n And I didn't have my gloves on because I only used them to search.\n\n1:56:42.820 --> 1:56:48.780\n So you want to bring everything back.\n\n1:56:48.780 --> 1:56:55.100\n This is what, even if they're dead, do you want to save, save those you served with?\n\n1:56:55.100 --> 1:56:56.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:57.200\n Because they deserve that.\n\n1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:00.380\n They don't deserve to have a piece of them drug behind a truck for propaganda.\n\n1:57:00.380 --> 1:57:02.260\n It's not, it's not fair.\n\n1:57:02.260 --> 1:57:03.260\n What are the others?\n\n1:57:03.260 --> 1:57:07.260\n I mean, was there just a focus on mission or was there a panic?\n\n1:57:07.260 --> 1:57:08.980\n No panic with these guys.\n\n1:57:08.980 --> 1:57:12.540\n These guys were the most switched on motherfuckers I've ever seen in my life.\n\n1:57:12.540 --> 1:57:19.600\n They, we started grabbing and remind me, he said, you know, you, uh, that's not, he goes,\n\n1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:21.820\n when people say that's the worst part of your day, that wasn't even the worst part of your\n\n1:57:21.820 --> 1:57:22.820\n day.\n\n1:57:22.820 --> 1:57:27.780\n Do you remember when you handed me the bag of intestines?\n\n1:57:27.780 --> 1:57:29.780\n No.\n\n1:57:29.780 --> 1:57:34.700\n No, I do though.\n\n1:57:34.700 --> 1:57:36.300\n Thank you for that.\n\n1:57:36.300 --> 1:57:39.060\n So there's parts you don't even, they're just not.\n\n1:57:39.060 --> 1:57:42.340\n They don't register.\n\n1:57:42.340 --> 1:57:45.740\n Because I had some people contact me and be like, you didn't tell it right.\n\n1:57:45.740 --> 1:57:51.660\n And war is subjective and war is from your perspective and war is messy and horrific\n\n1:57:51.660 --> 1:58:03.360\n and war is graphic and violent and painful.\n\n1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:07.300\n Your brain remembers what it wants to remember and your brain allows you to remember what\n\n1:58:07.300 --> 1:58:12.660\n it allows you to remember and there's reasons that you don't remember everything.\n\n1:58:12.660 --> 1:58:17.660\n And so we were getting, we were really getting hit.\n\n1:58:17.660 --> 1:58:19.860\n We were getting, it was bad.\n\n1:58:19.860 --> 1:58:25.420\n And some of the guys, machine gunners had come up to do cover fire and I know, uh, we\n\n1:58:25.420 --> 1:58:32.420\n were calling in for air support to come pick up the guys, uh, because they had to go.\n\n1:58:32.420 --> 1:58:39.020\n And we, we just collected everything we could, but I did remember screaming like, we didn't\n\n1:58:39.020 --> 1:58:40.020\n get them all.\n\n1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:41.020\n We didn't get them all.\n\n1:58:41.020 --> 1:58:42.020\n There's no way we got them all.\n\n1:58:42.020 --> 1:58:43.020\n We did not fucking get them all.\n\n1:58:43.020 --> 1:58:45.020\n And I remember one of the guys looking at me being like, we got them, we got them.\n\n1:58:45.020 --> 1:58:46.020\n I'm like, we didn't fucking get them.\n\n1:58:46.020 --> 1:58:47.020\n We didn't get them.\n\n1:58:47.020 --> 1:58:48.020\n Like, no, we got them.\n\n1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:50.780\n And I couldn't say it enough.\n\n1:58:50.780 --> 1:58:54.180\n And so I grabbed as much as I could.\n\n1:58:54.180 --> 1:59:00.380\n I, I, I, um, I slung one of their weapons and it was just a twisted heap and I had his\n\n1:59:00.380 --> 1:59:03.500\n helmet and someone else's helmet in my arm.\n\n1:59:03.500 --> 1:59:10.020\n And then I had, um, my weapon in front of me and I was carrying it.\n\n1:59:10.020 --> 1:59:13.740\n And then we, we piled everything we had onto a stretcher.\n\n1:59:13.740 --> 1:59:16.700\n Those things are super fucking flimsy anyway.\n\n1:59:16.700 --> 1:59:20.060\n And there was a couple of guys in front of us and there were a couple behind me and I\n\n1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:24.500\n was kind of in the middle and we, we said, okay, we're just gonna have to run.\n\n1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:25.500\n We're gonna have to fucking run the road.\n\n1:59:25.500 --> 1:59:26.500\n We're gonna have to have to run it.\n\n1:59:26.500 --> 1:59:27.500\n It was a chance.\n\n1:59:27.500 --> 1:59:32.440\n We ran it and that was the closest, well, that was I guess not the closest, but it felt\n\n1:59:32.440 --> 1:59:38.980\n like it was the closest I could hear the, the whiz of the rounds going by me.\n\n1:59:38.980 --> 1:59:43.980\n It's a weird noise when they're coming at you than when you're, they're leaving you.\n\n1:59:43.980 --> 1:59:47.860\n And so they, that slowed everything down for me.\n\n1:59:47.860 --> 1:59:51.400\n And then one of the guys accidentally dropped the edge of the stretcher and everything fell\n\n1:59:51.400 --> 1:59:56.380\n off into the ditch and then we had to go back down and get it back up.\n\n1:59:56.380 --> 2:00:00.700\n And then so we kept running and we finally got back into the compound that that sniper\n\n2:00:00.700 --> 2:00:05.260\n was sitting off on the right hand side and we got all in there.\n\n2:00:05.260 --> 2:00:09.060\n And I know the, I think said there was two flights.\n\n2:00:09.060 --> 2:00:12.700\n I only thought there was one, but apparently there was two flights.\n\n2:00:12.700 --> 2:00:15.400\n So went on one, his body went on one.\n\n2:00:15.400 --> 2:00:21.500\n And then I think, I think he said went on the other and and then they took off.\n\n2:00:21.500 --> 2:00:25.700\n And then when they leave though, they rain hell down on anything they can see on the\n\n2:00:25.700 --> 2:00:26.700\n ground.\n\n2:00:26.700 --> 2:00:30.420\n And that is a beautiful sight because they had mortar rounds coming down and it just,\n\n2:00:30.420 --> 2:00:33.100\n it was getting really, really bad.\n\n2:00:33.100 --> 2:00:41.220\n And then as soon as the black ox took off, all of a sudden it just stopped and went quiet,\n\n2:00:41.220 --> 2:00:44.820\n like deafening quiet.\n\n2:00:44.820 --> 2:00:48.500\n And we were sitting inside the compound and I, one of the medics looked at me and you\n\n2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:52.460\n could see, and I still do it now and I, I'm working on not doing it, but I do it when\n\n2:00:52.460 --> 2:00:55.020\n I get really overwhelmed.\n\n2:00:55.020 --> 2:01:00.020\n Because I didn't have any gloves on, I had blood all over my hands and just like body\n\n2:01:00.020 --> 2:01:01.020\n and stuff.\n\n2:01:01.020 --> 2:01:05.360\n So he came over and he just gave me like sanitizer and I started rubbing.\n\n2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:11.180\n And so I rub, I do this when I'm stressed, I'll rub my hands.\n\n2:01:11.180 --> 2:01:17.940\n And I still can't, I still can't do, I still can't eat food with skin on it.\n\n2:01:17.940 --> 2:01:22.420\n And I can't like, like salmon and stuff, like I can't, anything with skin, I can't touch\n\n2:01:22.420 --> 2:01:23.420\n it.\n\n2:01:23.420 --> 2:01:28.540\n And I'm making meat at home, like for my husband and my son, like I have like meat gloves and\n\n2:01:28.540 --> 2:01:31.420\n then I have like a fork and a knife and I'm like cutting it.\n\n2:01:31.420 --> 2:01:34.700\n Like I never touch it, I can't touch it.\n\n2:01:34.700 --> 2:01:43.540\n So there's something almost like the texture of the biology of a human flesh that just,\n\n2:01:43.540 --> 2:01:47.220\n that's at the level of, that's the level of your trauma.\n\n2:01:47.220 --> 2:01:48.220\n Yeah.\n\n2:01:48.220 --> 2:01:51.420\n And it's been, I mean, it's 2021, this was in 09.\n\n2:01:51.420 --> 2:01:57.180\n And I've worked on this, like, and I mean, I've been in like treatment religiously,\n\n2:01:57.180 --> 2:02:00.440\n just to be able to keep me alive for this decade.\n\n2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:04.060\n And so it's not like, it's like, oh, I've never, you never even tried to get better.\n\n2:02:04.060 --> 2:02:06.420\n It's like, I never really used to leave my house.\n\n2:02:06.420 --> 2:02:10.260\n I used to call people that looked like that horrific names in public.\n\n2:02:10.260 --> 2:02:13.640\n I used to want to kill people on a regular basis.\n\n2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:16.380\n I'm a fairly happy individual now.\n\n2:02:16.380 --> 2:02:24.540\n What about, so you're, you're talking about sort of skin and parts and, but there's also\n\n2:02:24.540 --> 2:02:31.180\n just the fact that we're mortal and there's somebody close to you who dies.\n\n2:02:31.180 --> 2:02:34.380\n So you watch, walk up and then never come back out again?\n\n2:02:34.380 --> 2:02:35.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:02:35.380 --> 2:02:38.780\n It's like you're facing mortality in a very real way.\n\n2:02:38.780 --> 2:02:44.820\n And if, in a, in a way that's not the same as somebody dying from cancer in a hospital,\n\n2:02:44.820 --> 2:02:48.860\n so it has echoes of that because that's also absurd.\n\n2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:55.220\n And like, it doesn't feel like there's justice to it in any kind of way, but it's so sudden.\n\n2:02:55.220 --> 2:03:03.140\n Like, have you been able to make sense of that, of your feelings about it?\n\n2:03:03.140 --> 2:03:11.380\n Like how do you feel about it or, or is everything just shrouded in this like trauma that you're\n\n2:03:11.380 --> 2:03:19.740\n not able to just feel for the loss of a human being, like mourn the loss of a human being?\n\n2:03:19.740 --> 2:03:28.540\n I think I had, when he, when I realized he wasn't there, when I realized that he, um,\n\n2:03:28.540 --> 2:03:33.880\n that was the, I, that was what was left of him, I found out afterwards there was other\n\n2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:37.740\n parts that were outside and went back.\n\n2:03:37.740 --> 2:03:43.180\n I think, I think he said went back and they got, they ended up getting the rest of him.\n\n2:03:43.180 --> 2:03:47.020\n So that made me happy because I just found this out this week.\n\n2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:54.160\n Uh, so that, that means, so that means you have a feeling like you still feel like parts\n\n2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:56.420\n of them were left behind.\n\n2:03:56.420 --> 2:03:57.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:57.860 --> 2:04:07.140\n On the ramp ceremony, when I lost my mind, literally I, I lost my mind and I was screaming\n\n2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:10.220\n that he wasn't all in there.\n\n2:04:10.220 --> 2:04:18.020\n I'm happy now knowing that he was, but I held onto that for 10 years.\n\n2:04:18.020 --> 2:04:19.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:19.020 --> 2:04:28.140\n This, um, yeah, the sandbags, like, like it's the bulk of the weight is, is not from human\n\n2:04:28.140 --> 2:04:29.140\n flesh.\n\n2:04:29.140 --> 2:04:30.140\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:30.140 --> 2:04:32.140\n He was a young kid too.\n\n2:04:32.140 --> 2:04:35.420\n It was, I think it was his first deployment as well.\n\n2:04:35.420 --> 2:04:42.980\n Like he was, he was a young kid and he was just, just going to clear the road for the\n\n2:04:42.980 --> 2:04:43.980\n rest of us.\n\n2:04:43.980 --> 2:04:44.980\n Right.\n\n2:04:44.980 --> 2:04:48.580\n Like not like, you know, you're in war and you know that you're outside the wire and\n\n2:04:48.580 --> 2:04:50.820\n you know, things could happen.\n\n2:04:50.820 --> 2:04:57.540\n You understand that to the extent you can understand that when it's happening, it's\n\n2:04:57.540 --> 2:04:59.660\n something very different.\n\n2:04:59.660 --> 2:05:07.180\n Also maybe you can correct me, but, um, there's something much more like brutal about an IED.\n\n2:05:07.180 --> 2:05:09.020\n It's proficuous.\n\n2:05:09.020 --> 2:05:15.860\n Versus like a bullet, cause a bullet, you still watching somebody close to you die from\n\n2:05:15.860 --> 2:05:20.940\n a bullet, you still get to the basic humanity.\n\n2:05:20.940 --> 2:05:26.980\n Like so IED basically converted a human being into sort of parts by biological parts.\n\n2:05:26.980 --> 2:05:28.660\n A cheeseburger.\n\n2:05:28.660 --> 2:05:35.540\n Versus, yeah, I mean, I don't, that's, that's tough.\n\n2:05:35.540 --> 2:05:43.580\n That's tough because that's like, um, because it's hard for you to remember them as a human.\n\n2:05:43.580 --> 2:05:45.940\n You remember them as parts.\n\n2:05:45.940 --> 2:05:48.400\n For me, that's how I remember him.\n\n2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:52.740\n I would like to, I have a picture that I post every year about him.\n\n2:05:52.740 --> 2:06:00.660\n I see that, but I don't put two and two together.\n\n2:06:00.660 --> 2:06:01.660\n Does that make sense?\n\n2:06:01.660 --> 2:06:03.220\n Yeah, no, it does.\n\n2:06:03.220 --> 2:06:08.120\n So I, even I listening to your story and, you know, um, thank you for sharing it first\n\n2:06:08.120 --> 2:06:12.940\n of all, but, um, it's not my, it's, well, I'm just the one to tell it.\n\n2:06:12.940 --> 2:06:19.420\n I was just involved one, one set of eyes on this particular human being.\n\n2:06:19.420 --> 2:06:20.980\n But even I get angry.\n\n2:06:20.980 --> 2:06:24.060\n I can't tell if it's exhaustion or anger.\n\n2:06:24.060 --> 2:06:25.060\n I'm sorry.\n\n2:06:25.060 --> 2:06:26.060\n I look always exhausted.\n\n2:06:26.060 --> 2:06:27.060\n Oh, that's okay.\n\n2:06:27.060 --> 2:06:28.060\n You're, you're into robotics.\n\n2:06:28.060 --> 2:06:29.060\n Isn't that like your guys's thing?\n\n2:06:29.060 --> 2:06:35.620\n You guys are just always working on, I think because I feel so much for the world.\n\n2:06:35.620 --> 2:06:39.500\n I just don't do, we were talking about resting bitch face earlier.\n\n2:06:39.500 --> 2:06:45.260\n I just don't feel the need to maintain, um, all the effort of the musculature for presenting\n\n2:06:45.260 --> 2:06:46.820\n myself to you visually.\n\n2:06:46.820 --> 2:06:47.820\n It's exhausting.\n\n2:06:47.820 --> 2:06:48.820\n It's exhausting.\n\n2:06:48.820 --> 2:06:49.820\n So I just focus on the feeling.\n\n2:06:49.820 --> 2:06:50.820\n No way.\n\n2:06:50.820 --> 2:06:52.500\n Face show, whatever the hell it shows.\n\n2:06:52.500 --> 2:06:53.500\n Fair enough.\n\n2:06:53.500 --> 2:06:54.500\n Okay.\n\n2:06:54.500 --> 2:06:56.300\n Was there anger?\n\n2:06:56.300 --> 2:06:57.300\n Was there hate?\n\n2:06:57.300 --> 2:06:58.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:58.300 --> 2:07:02.980\n Can you just talk to your feelings of what you remember?\n\n2:07:02.980 --> 2:07:03.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:07:03.980 --> 2:07:11.260\n So after that operation with the British, I went back to the Canadians and I didn't\n\n2:07:11.260 --> 2:07:16.500\n go back as even remotely close to who I was when I left.\n\n2:07:16.500 --> 2:07:22.140\n And that was really troublesome for a lot of people around me because the level of anger\n\n2:07:22.140 --> 2:07:29.420\n and hate that came out of me was palpable when I just walked by, um, I got shockingly\n\n2:07:29.420 --> 2:07:36.900\n quiet and you understand how you're learning how to be terrified if you are quiet.\n\n2:07:36.900 --> 2:07:41.700\n And I don't know if hate and anger do that justice.\n\n2:07:41.700 --> 2:07:47.780\n I don't know another word, but I don't think those two words do it justice to the extent\n\n2:07:47.780 --> 2:07:54.740\n that I was feeling like I got to a point when I got attacked by a woman, um, with some scissors,\n\n2:07:54.740 --> 2:07:59.060\n like the idea crossed my mind, like I could boot stomp her to death and not feel anything\n\n2:07:59.060 --> 2:08:01.820\n about it in front of her, all of her family and her kids.\n\n2:08:01.820 --> 2:08:06.860\n Was it more like just not recognizing the basic humanity or was it legit hatred?\n\n2:08:06.860 --> 2:08:13.380\n No, it was legit hatred, but also I no longer saw those people as humans.\n\n2:08:13.380 --> 2:08:14.700\n It took one event.\n\n2:08:14.700 --> 2:08:20.980\n And when that happened, the rest of the operation that was echoed in my, in the way I was to\n\n2:08:20.980 --> 2:08:21.980\n those people.\n\n2:08:21.980 --> 2:08:26.980\n But to what level can you see those people as human?\n\n2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:36.540\n So this is where, well, like this is where Jaco shut down, um, I still think I'm right.\n\n2:08:36.540 --> 2:08:45.100\n Um, there's a dire straight song called, uh, brothers in arms and, um, actually anyway,\n\n2:08:45.100 --> 2:08:48.620\n we're fools to make war on our brothers in arms.\n\n2:08:48.620 --> 2:08:58.460\n And I brought that up to Jaco because it's humans on both sides, but he said, not in\n\n2:08:58.460 --> 2:09:04.620\n Iraq like to him, he's like, no, that's the enemy.\n\n2:09:04.620 --> 2:09:07.740\n These are people who use the civilians.\n\n2:09:07.740 --> 2:09:12.300\n They rape, they torture, they they'll do anything.\n\n2:09:12.300 --> 2:09:14.020\n And they put evil onto the world.\n\n2:09:14.020 --> 2:09:18.220\n And then it's like, so they're, they're stood on at that moment.\n\n2:09:18.220 --> 2:09:26.660\n Like the, these two were humans and it's politicians waging war and it's, it's kids on both sides.\n\n2:09:26.660 --> 2:09:31.300\n But then Jaco was like, no, he's not wrong.\n\n2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:36.260\n So which can you carry both things with you as a soldier?\n\n2:09:36.260 --> 2:09:40.380\n I think when I was a soldier, I could only carry one thing with me.\n\n2:09:40.380 --> 2:09:48.060\n I think my perspective has changed drastically, but not because I've lost the reality that\n\n2:09:48.060 --> 2:09:54.060\n they are the enemy, but I've, I've gained my humanity back again.\n\n2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:55.980\n And that's what I lost when I was there.\n\n2:09:55.980 --> 2:09:57.180\n I lost all humanity.\n\n2:09:57.180 --> 2:09:59.580\n I lost all hope for humanity.\n\n2:09:59.580 --> 2:10:07.180\n He's not wrong when he says the Taliban or like when he was in Iraq, but for me, the\n\n2:10:07.180 --> 2:10:08.460\n Taliban are evil.\n\n2:10:08.460 --> 2:10:15.020\n I still hold a spot of hatred for them that could set this building on fire.\n\n2:10:15.020 --> 2:10:20.880\n You don't, I don't know that anybody can fully understand that when you watch what they do\n\n2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:28.100\n to women and do kids and they do it in the name of God, they are the enemy.\n\n2:10:28.100 --> 2:10:32.240\n They are less than, they don't exist.\n\n2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:36.320\n They're barely worth the bullets we put into them.\n\n2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:45.180\n But then because they use civilians, so like then everybody becomes the enemy.\n\n2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:47.100\n And how are you supposed to make sense of that?\n\n2:10:47.100 --> 2:10:50.140\n Like what you get, but here, Lex, you can't make sense of it.\n\n2:10:50.140 --> 2:10:54.340\n This is why they've done a really good job of blending into the civilian population.\n\n2:10:54.340 --> 2:10:55.420\n They've done it intentionally.\n\n2:10:55.420 --> 2:10:57.740\n They've done it on purpose.\n\n2:10:57.740 --> 2:10:59.420\n So they're brilliant.\n\n2:10:59.420 --> 2:11:01.060\n This is why you guys couldn't beat them.\n\n2:11:01.060 --> 2:11:03.420\n This is why we couldn't fucking beat them.\n\n2:11:03.420 --> 2:11:07.380\n They use their people so effectively.\n\n2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:08.820\n They have no shame in that.\n\n2:11:08.820 --> 2:11:10.240\n They have no issue with that.\n\n2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:14.740\n They take no qualms with wiping a kid off the face of the earth.\n\n2:11:14.740 --> 2:11:18.700\n If it means they can get close enough to a soldier to throw a fucking bomb into their\n\n2:11:18.700 --> 2:11:20.260\n tank.\n\n2:11:20.260 --> 2:11:22.100\n This is why they're affected.\n\n2:11:22.100 --> 2:11:23.800\n How do you beat them then?\n\n2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:30.020\n There's this, there's no winning that you just basically do policeman type work or you\n\n2:11:30.020 --> 2:11:31.020\n do your best.\n\n2:11:31.020 --> 2:11:33.260\n I mean, that's one way.\n\n2:11:33.260 --> 2:11:38.620\n So the other is you come from an artillery background.\n\n2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:42.500\n A fucking hellfire missile hit the whole place off the face of the earth.\n\n2:11:42.500 --> 2:11:45.220\n You can't beat radicalism like that right now.\n\n2:11:45.220 --> 2:11:48.820\n The problem is, is we've, we've let it go unchecked.\n\n2:11:48.820 --> 2:11:52.300\n We had it kind of in check for 20 years.\n\n2:11:52.300 --> 2:11:56.820\n We just shot ourselves in the foot, the chest and the face.\n\n2:11:56.820 --> 2:12:07.340\n So the problem with force is it creates longterm hate because young kids and propaganda and\n\n2:12:07.340 --> 2:12:09.160\n like propaganda works.\n\n2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:14.380\n So you, you see your father, your brother die because of a bomb.\n\n2:12:14.380 --> 2:12:19.420\n It's very easy to convince that person that they died because of evil Americans and tell\n\n2:12:19.420 --> 2:12:22.220\n whatever story you want about America or Canada, Russia.\n\n2:12:22.220 --> 2:12:23.380\n That's the biggest problem.\n\n2:12:23.380 --> 2:12:30.040\n So it seems like there gotta be better solutions because I mean, I talk about love, but it's,\n\n2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:36.940\n it's honestly basically figuring out sneaky ways of empowering women, of educating people\n\n2:12:36.940 --> 2:12:48.620\n of like, and like, and not in a cheesy way, but like in the same level of like mass warfare,\n\n2:12:48.620 --> 2:12:49.620\n but with love.\n\n2:12:49.620 --> 2:12:56.420\n You're talking about DARPA budgets, DOD budgets, but like do that where you educate and empower\n\n2:12:56.420 --> 2:12:58.900\n women by force.\n\n2:12:58.900 --> 2:13:01.140\n And it, you know, they want to learn, right?\n\n2:13:01.140 --> 2:13:05.100\n I mean, you're not like forcing anybody, you're setting them free.\n\n2:13:05.100 --> 2:13:06.100\n That's exactly it.\n\n2:13:06.100 --> 2:13:07.460\n Like combat flip flops does this.\n\n2:13:07.460 --> 2:13:08.460\n They do this.\n\n2:13:08.460 --> 2:13:10.060\n They give literacy.\n\n2:13:10.060 --> 2:13:15.980\n They teach girls to read nothing else to read because as soon as you can read, you know\n\n2:13:15.980 --> 2:13:16.980\n what that happens.\n\n2:13:16.980 --> 2:13:18.220\n You know what happens then.\n\n2:13:18.220 --> 2:13:19.580\n What's combat flip flops?\n\n2:13:19.580 --> 2:13:20.660\n That's the scarf right there.\n\n2:13:20.660 --> 2:13:23.420\n That's made in Afghanistan.\n\n2:13:23.420 --> 2:13:28.340\n So when you buy something from them, the proceeds go to literacy in Afghanistan for girls.\n\n2:13:28.340 --> 2:13:30.660\n They've given literacy to 800 girls over there.\n\n2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:31.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:31.660 --> 2:13:32.660\n They're really cool.\n\n2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:37.060\n Uh, Griff owns the one, he was an army ranger and his buddy, but Lee, I think is his name.\n\n2:13:37.060 --> 2:13:41.420\n They were on Shark Tank a long time ago, but they, um, they do shoes and I think they're\n\n2:13:41.420 --> 2:13:42.420\n called Schmongs.\n\n2:13:42.420 --> 2:13:44.740\n I don't know how to say it properly.\n\n2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:45.740\n Built in Afghanistan.\n\n2:13:45.740 --> 2:13:46.740\n Yes.\n\n2:13:46.740 --> 2:13:48.380\n And then the proceeds go back there.\n\n2:13:48.380 --> 2:13:54.000\n They do great work for literacy and you know, as well as anyone, if you can teach someone\n\n2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:01.980\n to read good color, dark, like your soul lacks matches on the inside, just on the inside.\n\n2:14:01.980 --> 2:14:02.980\n All right.\n\n2:14:02.980 --> 2:14:06.460\n The outside is just the, it's just the suit.\n\n2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:10.860\n I feel like you think that's your suit of armor, but I feel like it's, it's there.\n\n2:14:10.860 --> 2:14:11.860\n See what were you saying?\n\n2:14:11.860 --> 2:14:12.860\n Sorry, what were you saying?\n\n2:14:12.860 --> 2:14:13.860\n I was saying go on.\n\n2:14:13.860 --> 2:14:14.860\n I will allow this.\n\n2:14:14.860 --> 2:14:20.900\n All right, I think there is room if you teach education.\n\n2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:24.780\n The problem is we've taken a massive step backwards.\n\n2:14:24.780 --> 2:14:30.820\n I know that the Taliban have just instituted, uh, this week honor killings will be back.\n\n2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:35.180\n Stonings are back and, um, uh, dismemberment as well.\n\n2:14:35.180 --> 2:14:37.940\n Holly McKay is the reporter that's been reporting that from the ground.\n\n2:14:37.940 --> 2:14:39.300\n She's still there.\n\n2:14:39.300 --> 2:14:45.180\n The way to pull people, in my opinion, out of something like that is through education.\n\n2:14:45.180 --> 2:14:51.700\n Well we just took all of that away, which is pretty horrific in my opinion because you've\n\n2:14:51.700 --> 2:14:54.380\n taught over 20 years.\n\n2:14:54.380 --> 2:14:55.520\n You're perfectly right, Lex.\n\n2:14:55.520 --> 2:15:01.540\n When you say that hate and violence won't work, it won't because you see dad get killed\n\n2:15:01.540 --> 2:15:02.540\n on the battlefield.\n\n2:15:02.540 --> 2:15:06.300\n Well that 14 year old little boy is going to pick up an AK 47 and go avenge dad's death.\n\n2:15:06.300 --> 2:15:07.300\n That's just the way it's going to be.\n\n2:15:07.300 --> 2:15:10.340\n Well, we think about it, you were there for 20 years.\n\n2:15:10.340 --> 2:15:11.820\n There's a couple of generations in there.\n\n2:15:11.820 --> 2:15:16.400\n There's another generation that's either grown up in this or has seen enough of this.\n\n2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:22.020\n So there are always going to be a subset that think that we're the enemy and fair.\n\n2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:25.800\n We haven't done always the greatest things, but the one thing that we have done that I\n\n2:15:25.800 --> 2:15:31.620\n did participate in was giving literacy, giving girls an opportunity, letting them know that\n\n2:15:31.620 --> 2:15:33.840\n you aren't second class citizens.\n\n2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:35.740\n You can do things too.\n\n2:15:35.740 --> 2:15:40.660\n And that's why we have to look at war differently.\n\n2:15:40.660 --> 2:15:42.060\n There's times for violence.\n\n2:15:42.060 --> 2:15:50.780\n Oh, there is time for violence and there is time for missiles and there is time for detainees\n\n2:15:50.780 --> 2:15:54.180\n and there's times for bagging tags and double tops of the fucking face.\n\n2:15:54.180 --> 2:15:59.500\n There's times for all of that, but there needs to be more time to educate.\n\n2:15:59.500 --> 2:16:04.420\n The problem is you can't educate if you're in a country where their culture doesn't believe\n\n2:16:04.420 --> 2:16:05.420\n in that.\n\n2:16:05.420 --> 2:16:12.700\n There's so many different things that you, it's an almost an impossible situation.\n\n2:16:12.700 --> 2:16:17.300\n When you look at the 20 years in Afghanistan and we just pulled out, there's a sudden pull\n\n2:16:17.300 --> 2:16:18.300\n out of troops.\n\n2:16:18.300 --> 2:16:21.740\n What do you think about those 20 years?\n\n2:16:21.740 --> 2:16:31.140\n Let me ask hard question, which is, was it worth it going into Afghanistan?\n\n2:16:31.140 --> 2:16:33.460\n And you're sort of, you're one person.\n\n2:16:33.460 --> 2:16:35.100\n My limited capacity.\n\n2:16:35.100 --> 2:16:41.500\n You have experienced specific set of extremely difficult things.\n\n2:16:41.500 --> 2:16:44.020\n You've met a lot of humans.\n\n2:16:44.020 --> 2:16:47.460\n You understand certain aspects of the way this war is carried out.\n\n2:16:47.460 --> 2:16:52.460\n But if you zoomed out at the big story, like you're, you like history too.\n\n2:16:52.460 --> 2:16:59.380\n When you think of the history, a hundred years from now, we look at the invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n2:16:59.380 --> 2:17:04.780\n I don't even think you need to go far that back to know that it was, we went in on false\n\n2:17:04.780 --> 2:17:06.300\n pretenses.\n\n2:17:06.300 --> 2:17:07.300\n We did.\n\n2:17:07.300 --> 2:17:10.460\n That's not, that's not a good start.\n\n2:17:10.460 --> 2:17:11.660\n What's that saying?\n\n2:17:11.660 --> 2:17:18.340\n Future behavior is a good, was it past behavior is a good indicator of future behavior.\n\n2:17:18.340 --> 2:17:24.780\n So I struggle with that because when I first found out that the pullout was going to happen,\n\n2:17:24.780 --> 2:17:33.700\n I got really angry because my government skated the whole situation because he's having a\n\n2:17:33.700 --> 2:17:34.700\n snap.\n\n2:17:34.700 --> 2:17:35.700\n He's having a snap election.\n\n2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:38.220\n It's happening on the 20th.\n\n2:17:38.220 --> 2:17:46.860\n So that was beautifully planned by my government to hold no accountability, zero accountability.\n\n2:17:46.860 --> 2:17:49.100\n And the media won't talk about it.\n\n2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:51.260\n They reached out to me to do an interview about Afghanistan.\n\n2:17:51.260 --> 2:17:54.780\n And then I told them what was going on after I talked to my people that were on the ground\n\n2:17:54.780 --> 2:17:56.820\n and then they canceled the interview.\n\n2:17:56.820 --> 2:18:01.500\n When you say my government, is America any better at this, like it feels like there's\n\n2:18:01.500 --> 2:18:02.500\n no accountability.\n\n2:18:02.500 --> 2:18:03.500\n No, no.\n\n2:18:03.500 --> 2:18:08.860\n The government, no, no, the American government is a dumpster fire.\n\n2:18:08.860 --> 2:18:16.420\n I'm not saying, I'm not saying that, but what I am saying is at least they sent people to\n\n2:18:16.420 --> 2:18:20.300\n pull people or pull some people.\n\n2:18:20.300 --> 2:18:24.400\n We sent no one to pull anyone.\n\n2:18:24.400 --> 2:18:28.420\n And I know for a fact, because I helped move a family, I was fortunate enough to be given\n\n2:18:28.420 --> 2:18:33.620\n an opportunity to help move a high value nine person family out of that country that worked\n\n2:18:33.620 --> 2:18:38.940\n in the government, that worked in prosecuting the Taliban, that were on the top of the list.\n\n2:18:38.940 --> 2:18:42.980\n I learned really quickly the ins and outs of things and I'm really disgusted by it.\n\n2:18:42.980 --> 2:18:48.820\n I learned that Canada had the one email address that all Canadian Afghani visa holders were\n\n2:18:48.820 --> 2:18:54.020\n supposed to email, Ottawa put two people on that email address.\n\n2:18:54.020 --> 2:18:56.020\n That's confirmed.\n\n2:18:56.020 --> 2:18:59.860\n Canada put no more than 70 people on the ground for that pullout and they were not allowed\n\n2:18:59.860 --> 2:19:02.380\n to leave the airport and they left well before the pullout date.\n\n2:19:02.380 --> 2:19:07.340\n They left on the Thursday before the Tuesday that was the 31st.\n\n2:19:07.340 --> 2:19:11.300\n There were high value Canadian visa holders that are still in that country that are on\n\n2:19:11.300 --> 2:19:12.820\n the top of the kill list.\n\n2:19:12.820 --> 2:19:17.020\n Canada's not doing anything about it.\n\n2:19:17.020 --> 2:19:21.740\n I'm disgusted in the way my government has acted because number one, there's an active\n\n2:19:21.740 --> 2:19:27.520\n lawsuit with veterans against the Supreme Court of Canada right now.\n\n2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:33.420\n We are leaving our vets and our Canadians stranded over there and we are leaving the\n\n2:19:33.420 --> 2:19:38.020\n vets that have been maimed by this war in Canada.\n\n2:19:38.020 --> 2:19:39.020\n They're turned down for everything.\n\n2:19:39.020 --> 2:19:40.320\n I've been turned down for hearing loss.\n\n2:19:40.320 --> 2:19:42.820\n They're saying it's not military related.\n\n2:19:42.820 --> 2:19:45.200\n They have PIs follow me.\n\n2:19:45.200 --> 2:19:47.500\n This is normal behavior.\n\n2:19:47.500 --> 2:19:52.860\n There's a veteran named Brock who was told by Trudeau in a meeting that after he lost\n\n2:19:52.860 --> 2:19:57.180\n his leg, he was just trying to get a new prosthetic because it was just killing him.\n\n2:19:57.180 --> 2:20:00.620\n Trudeau stood up in a meeting and said, you're just asking for too much.\n\n2:20:00.620 --> 2:20:05.420\n Less than six months later, he gave $10.4 million to an Afghan terrorist that was in\n\n2:20:05.420 --> 2:20:07.540\n the Canadian prison system.\n\n2:20:07.540 --> 2:20:11.980\n He won and got 10.4 of our million taxpayer dollars.\n\n2:20:11.980 --> 2:20:16.980\n I don't know that American government's any better, but what I do know is that the absolute\n\n2:20:16.980 --> 2:20:21.580\n fucking machines of human beings that stepped outside of the chain of command to pull my\n\n2:20:21.580 --> 2:20:25.260\n family out for me, I know they were there.\n\n2:20:25.260 --> 2:20:30.620\n The British that stayed on the ground that I contacted to literally confirm my biometric\n\n2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:33.740\n data and passports to get that family moved, they weren't there.\n\n2:20:33.740 --> 2:20:35.700\n That family would still be there.\n\n2:20:35.700 --> 2:20:38.540\n That three year old that got the shit kicked out of him by the Taliban that I was trying\n\n2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:44.120\n to exfil, Canada left him.\n\n2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:52.100\n What is it about politicians and governments not willing to do their job?\n\n2:20:52.100 --> 2:21:03.260\n Well, not willing to do a big part of the job, which is you send people to war, these\n\n2:21:03.260 --> 2:21:12.900\n are heroes, and then you should spend most of the time repaying the debts to those, right?\n\n2:21:12.900 --> 2:21:15.740\n What is it about, why can't we?\n\n2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:20.140\n Because we're disposable numbers, and we hire them out of high school when they're stupid\n\n2:21:20.140 --> 2:21:25.300\n enough to not understand what they're going to get themselves into, and then we blame\n\n2:21:25.300 --> 2:21:27.980\n it on themselves for making that decision by volunteering.\n\n2:21:27.980 --> 2:21:32.180\n Yeah, but I mean, this still doesn't make sense to me.\n\n2:21:32.180 --> 2:21:33.180\n No, it's a cop out.\n\n2:21:33.180 --> 2:21:39.500\n I mean, Trudeau, I feel like he is a good human being that wants to do good for, I mean,\n\n2:21:39.500 --> 2:21:45.820\n I tend to, I want to believe that leaders want to do good by the heroes of this world,\n\n2:21:45.820 --> 2:21:53.540\n and it doesn't, like, I don't understand the system of delusion you have to live in to\n\n2:21:53.540 --> 2:21:55.300\n not understand who the heroes are.\n\n2:21:55.300 --> 2:21:58.020\n Like, I refuse to believe Trudeau is somehow a bad person.\n\n2:21:58.020 --> 2:21:59.460\n You haven't met him though, have you?\n\n2:21:59.460 --> 2:22:00.460\n I don't, actually.\n\n2:22:00.460 --> 2:22:06.300\n I'm speaking about Trudeau without knowing, but I mean, in general, think that way about\n\n2:22:06.300 --> 2:22:07.300\n leaders.\n\n2:22:07.300 --> 2:22:12.100\n Like, they surround themselves by people who delude them, who like, they're yes people,\n\n2:22:12.100 --> 2:22:18.820\n yes people that lead them into a kind of reality that becomes detached from actual reality.\n\n2:22:18.820 --> 2:22:21.940\n And so they misunderstand the priorities of this world.\n\n2:22:21.940 --> 2:22:28.900\n They think maybe some kind of special interest, they focus on that versus like the humans.\n\n2:22:28.900 --> 2:22:34.220\n If you look back, was there a way we could have done something better in Afghanistan,\n\n2:22:34.220 --> 2:22:36.560\n assuming we do the invasion?\n\n2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:44.380\n Also, is it ultimately about taking care of the veterans, like, investing more money in\n\n2:22:44.380 --> 2:22:53.840\n the education of women and liberating people who are suffering injustice in those parts\n\n2:22:53.840 --> 2:22:54.840\n of the world?\n\n2:22:54.840 --> 2:22:56.060\n Like, what's a better way to do it?\n\n2:22:56.060 --> 2:23:02.980\n And one other aspect is, on the US side, paid over $6 trillion for the wars in the Middle\n\n2:23:02.980 --> 2:23:06.260\n East since 9 11, so the financial side as well.\n\n2:23:06.260 --> 2:23:11.900\n Is there something you can comment on things we could have done better?\n\n2:23:11.900 --> 2:23:16.620\n That's a loaded question because you're talking to someone who had no hand in what happened\n\n2:23:16.620 --> 2:23:18.500\n other than do this and do that.\n\n2:23:18.500 --> 2:23:22.700\n So I can go from my perspective, which is there was probably plenty of things that we\n\n2:23:22.700 --> 2:23:24.900\n could have been doing better.\n\n2:23:24.900 --> 2:23:27.620\n I think there was a lack of leadership from the get go.\n\n2:23:27.620 --> 2:23:34.580\n I think the preparation that the Canadian military gave me was nowhere sufficient for\n\n2:23:34.580 --> 2:23:37.340\n a deployment of that level.\n\n2:23:37.340 --> 2:23:38.900\n Mind you, things happen.\n\n2:23:38.900 --> 2:23:43.820\n They didn't realize things would happen, but yet they happen.\n\n2:23:43.820 --> 2:23:50.460\n With little to absolutely no cultural idea was that I was walking into.\n\n2:23:50.460 --> 2:23:55.140\n Like when the one male in the family grabbed the back of my vest because my hair was tucked\n\n2:23:55.140 --> 2:23:57.780\n and he thought it was a man going into a room with a bunch of women, I couldn't understand\n\n2:23:57.780 --> 2:24:00.300\n why he was attacking me.\n\n2:24:00.300 --> 2:24:05.540\n There was no real breakdown of this is what you're going into, this is the culture, this\n\n2:24:05.540 --> 2:24:10.580\n is why they do what they do, this is how they do it, this is how you should handle a situation\n\n2:24:10.580 --> 2:24:11.580\n like that.\n\n2:24:11.580 --> 2:24:13.500\n There was none of that.\n\n2:24:13.500 --> 2:24:17.260\n Something I speak about frequently and I think it's important to acknowledge is when you're\n\n2:24:17.260 --> 2:24:21.020\n doing any of that training, we are giving none of our soldiers proper mental health\n\n2:24:21.020 --> 2:24:28.500\n training, tools in that fucking toolbox or ways or things to look for on their buddy\n\n2:24:28.500 --> 2:24:34.060\n because we've created a system and a problem where if you say that you're ill or that you're\n\n2:24:34.060 --> 2:24:36.980\n struggling with PTSD, you're done.\n\n2:24:36.980 --> 2:24:40.060\n No one's going to say that, they're going to keep struggling with it and that's when\n\n2:24:40.060 --> 2:24:45.280\n you get loose cannons, when you get problems happen, so you get fractures start to happen\n\n2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:51.100\n in leadership and that's being seen and has been seen now for a while.\n\n2:24:51.100 --> 2:24:59.980\n In terms of what we could have done, say for a better way to go into the country, a better\n\n2:24:59.980 --> 2:25:07.620\n way to help the country, I can't speak to that as much as I wish I could because I don't\n\n2:25:07.620 --> 2:25:09.260\n know that I would have all the answers.\n\n2:25:09.260 --> 2:25:11.700\n What about withdrawal?\n\n2:25:11.700 --> 2:25:14.220\n Oh my God.\n\n2:25:14.220 --> 2:25:15.220\n That's a cold.\n\n2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:24.260\n Do you think more gradual, you think it's better to maintain presence there for indefinitely?\n\n2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:30.980\n I don't know about that, but I do know we have bases, I say weeks, I serve with them,\n\n2:25:30.980 --> 2:25:36.360\n Americans have bases in Japan, Americans have bases in Korea, Americans have bases in Germany.\n\n2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:38.420\n There's reasons there's bases everywhere.\n\n2:25:38.420 --> 2:25:42.400\n There's a smart, there's an intellectual way to look at this.\n\n2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:47.480\n You want to be able to have eyes and ears, can't have eyes and ears when you do things\n\n2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:49.160\n like you just did.\n\n2:25:49.160 --> 2:25:53.100\n The way that we pulled out of that country, that's right, the way that, I hate saying\n\n2:25:53.100 --> 2:25:54.940\n American British because it puts like a blame on them.\n\n2:25:54.940 --> 2:25:58.940\n I say we because I'm a soldier, I'm a NATO soldier.\n\n2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:03.880\n The way we pulled out of that country, my five year old could have done it better.\n\n2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:07.860\n He could have said, mommy, why are we not keeping that Bagram base?\n\n2:26:07.860 --> 2:26:12.580\n Mommy, why are we not keeping that base just until we get everyone else that we need?\n\n2:26:12.580 --> 2:26:16.340\n Why are we going to a civilian airport that we don't control, that we don't understand?\n\n2:26:16.340 --> 2:26:20.740\n Mommy, why are we doing this when there's only one road to it?\n\n2:26:20.740 --> 2:26:24.660\n My five year old would have that conversation with me.\n\n2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:27.300\n It was so poorly done.\n\n2:26:27.300 --> 2:26:31.740\n It was so poorly executed and no fault of the soldiers on the ground on their own.\n\n2:26:31.740 --> 2:26:36.880\n My God, I can tell you there's operators, I just call them A, I don't say who he is\n\n2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:38.460\n because he's told me not to.\n\n2:26:38.460 --> 2:26:42.740\n There's a guy named A and there's another guy named R and there's a few other named\n\n2:26:42.740 --> 2:26:52.100\n D and these guys, they gave everything to try to pull my family when no one else would\n\n2:26:52.100 --> 2:26:54.620\n pull my family for me.\n\n2:26:54.620 --> 2:26:56.780\n They just got me on the phone and said, I don't know who the fuck you're talking to.\n\n2:26:56.780 --> 2:26:59.440\n I don't know how many people you're trying to get ahold of here, but you've got everyone\n\n2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:00.440\n looking for your family.\n\n2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:02.620\n Six, I've gone to everyone I know.\n\n2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:04.100\n I've done stuff on Instagram.\n\n2:27:04.100 --> 2:27:05.100\n I've got a contact.\n\n2:27:05.100 --> 2:27:06.100\n The contact called me.\n\n2:27:06.100 --> 2:27:07.660\n I called them.\n\n2:27:07.660 --> 2:27:12.860\n I was handling this family and when they call you and say, we can't go back to the gate,\n\n2:27:12.860 --> 2:27:17.740\n my three year old just got beat up by the Taliban and they say, what do we do now?\n\n2:27:17.740 --> 2:27:20.540\n I'm in Vancouver.\n\n2:27:20.540 --> 2:27:23.340\n Why am I being left to deal with this?\n\n2:27:23.340 --> 2:27:27.780\n Why is the civilian and ex military population being left to deal with this?\n\n2:27:27.780 --> 2:27:29.620\n Why was this not thought out?\n\n2:27:29.620 --> 2:27:31.980\n We knew this was coming.\n\n2:27:31.980 --> 2:27:33.460\n We knew the timeframe.\n\n2:27:33.460 --> 2:27:38.940\n Yeah, I ultimately blame, it almost starts at the top always at the leadership, sorry,\n\n2:27:38.940 --> 2:27:41.940\n this is the civilian leadership.\n\n2:27:41.940 --> 2:27:46.460\n I think probably the generals know the right thing to do here.\n\n2:27:46.460 --> 2:27:51.460\n Even if they're sometimes overzealous in terms of being, wanting to increase, I think the\n\n2:27:51.460 --> 2:27:53.620\n great generals understand what's needed.\n\n2:27:53.620 --> 2:27:57.420\n And then it takes great leadership on the civilian side to listen to the generals and\n\n2:27:57.420 --> 2:28:00.900\n understand that war is not just about like.\n\n2:28:00.900 --> 2:28:02.220\n It's not binary.\n\n2:28:02.220 --> 2:28:07.620\n Yeah, and it's not about the invasion and saying mission accomplished.\n\n2:28:07.620 --> 2:28:08.820\n It's not about the PR.\n\n2:28:08.820 --> 2:28:13.100\n It's about the full complexity of geopolitics.\n\n2:28:13.100 --> 2:28:14.100\n Can I ask you this?\n\n2:28:14.100 --> 2:28:16.380\n You can ask me whatever you want.\n\n2:28:16.380 --> 2:28:18.660\n I'm looking at a book that you gave me, Do the Fucking Work.\n\n2:28:18.660 --> 2:28:19.660\n It's very motivating.\n\n2:28:19.660 --> 2:28:21.900\n Good Fucking Design Advice.\n\n2:28:21.900 --> 2:28:24.860\n That's their company called Good Fucking Design Advice.\n\n2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:25.860\n That's great.\n\n2:28:25.860 --> 2:28:26.860\n I know, they're great.\n\n2:28:26.860 --> 2:28:27.860\n What's the website?\n\n2:28:27.860 --> 2:28:28.860\n GFDA.\n\n2:28:28.860 --> 2:28:32.380\n Okay, so the F is for friendship.\n\n2:28:32.380 --> 2:28:33.380\n Something like that.\n\n2:28:33.380 --> 2:28:35.420\n They are a design company.\n\n2:28:35.420 --> 2:28:37.620\n They've worked with Apple and Nike, and this is their book.\n\n2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:39.420\n It's been published by HarperCollins.\n\n2:28:39.420 --> 2:28:44.900\n And it is really just, it's an incredible, they're an incredible company.\n\n2:28:44.900 --> 2:28:49.580\n They're artistically, like they're a design company, so you can see that.\n\n2:28:49.580 --> 2:28:50.700\n You can see it's a design company.\n\n2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:52.500\n Oh yeah, they signed it for you.\n\n2:28:52.500 --> 2:28:58.780\n And the pages are beautiful, but they have a saying and then a paragraph about each saying.\n\n2:28:58.780 --> 2:29:04.420\n Get fucking started, obstacles are fucking opportunities, fail, fail, and fucking fail\n\n2:29:04.420 --> 2:29:05.420\n again.\n\n2:29:05.420 --> 2:29:11.820\n Ask for fucking help, show some fucking passion, finish the fucking job.\n\n2:29:11.820 --> 2:29:12.820\n That's right.\n\n2:29:12.820 --> 2:29:13.820\n So we should send that to Biden.\n\n2:29:13.820 --> 2:29:15.340\n So I...\n\n2:29:15.340 --> 2:29:16.620\n She said it, I didn't say it.\n\n2:29:16.620 --> 2:29:17.620\n Lex said it.\n\n2:29:17.620 --> 2:29:18.620\n I didn't say it.\n\n2:29:18.620 --> 2:29:19.620\n Lex said it.\n\n2:29:19.620 --> 2:29:20.620\n It's fine.\n\n2:29:20.620 --> 2:29:21.620\n I'll say it.\n\n2:29:21.620 --> 2:29:22.620\n I should also send it to Trudeau as well.\n\n2:29:22.620 --> 2:29:23.940\n So, but I mean, he probably won't know how to read it.\n\n2:29:23.940 --> 2:29:25.900\n He just taught drama instead.\n\n2:29:25.900 --> 2:29:29.340\n So I'll send it to the previous four presidents.\n\n2:29:29.340 --> 2:29:30.340\n How about that?\n\n2:29:30.340 --> 2:29:31.340\n That's fine.\n\n2:29:31.340 --> 2:29:32.340\n We can also send it to them too.\n\n2:29:32.340 --> 2:29:33.340\n Cause they're all just as much at fault.\n\n2:29:33.340 --> 2:29:38.740\n So, and they, most of them have all the same last names, but okay.\n\n2:29:38.740 --> 2:29:39.740\n Let me tell you about them quickly.\n\n2:29:39.740 --> 2:29:42.460\n Cause we did a mug with them and I was really excited about it.\n\n2:29:42.460 --> 2:29:43.460\n Not because it was a mug.\n\n2:29:43.460 --> 2:29:47.060\n I'm a mug person, but you are, that's your mug obsessive.\n\n2:29:47.060 --> 2:29:48.460\n I'm obsessive about my mugs.\n\n2:29:48.460 --> 2:29:50.260\n What's your favorite mug?\n\n2:29:50.260 --> 2:29:51.260\n Currently it's mine right now.\n\n2:29:51.260 --> 2:29:52.260\n The one that I have with them.\n\n2:29:52.260 --> 2:29:53.260\n Okay.\n\n2:29:53.260 --> 2:29:54.260\n The GMT mug.\n\n2:29:54.260 --> 2:29:55.260\n What does it say on it?\n\n2:29:55.260 --> 2:29:57.580\n Can I, do you want me to read what it says on it?\n\n2:29:57.580 --> 2:29:58.580\n Yeah, please.\n\n2:29:58.580 --> 2:29:59.580\n Okay.\n\n2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:04.620\n Cause I'm really happy about it because we created this with them, with GFDA.\n\n2:30:04.620 --> 2:30:09.720\n I found out about them because my husband's office, Atlas Neck Brace, he had his very\n\n2:30:09.720 --> 2:30:14.300\n first office, he had one of their prints done and it was their original, like do the fucking\n\n2:30:14.300 --> 2:30:15.860\n work.\n\n2:30:15.860 --> 2:30:20.860\n And I was really excited about them once I found out because I'm like, well, fuck is\n\n2:30:20.860 --> 2:30:22.260\n my middle name.\n\n2:30:22.260 --> 2:30:28.740\n And I want to make sure that I am going to, whoever I work with, I want to make sure that\n\n2:30:28.740 --> 2:30:35.500\n I'm working with people that I believe in, that I believe what they stand for and I just\n\n2:30:35.500 --> 2:30:36.500\n think they're brilliant.\n\n2:30:36.500 --> 2:30:42.020\n So I got on the phone with them and I said, hi, I would like you to sponsor my podcast.\n\n2:30:42.020 --> 2:30:43.020\n And they said, cool.\n\n2:30:43.020 --> 2:30:44.340\n What's your podcast?\n\n2:30:44.340 --> 2:30:49.540\n And I was like, it's called Brass in Unity podcast and I want to work with you guys somewhere.\n\n2:30:49.540 --> 2:30:52.320\n And they're like, okay, so like, what are you thinking?\n\n2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:56.980\n And I said, you know, I'm looking to do, I would love one day to do something with you.\n\n2:30:56.980 --> 2:31:00.420\n I don't know what it would be, but I would like it to be something.\n\n2:31:00.420 --> 2:31:03.780\n And they said, you know, we do like, we have this book, but we also have like shirts and\n\n2:31:03.780 --> 2:31:06.320\n mugs with our sayings on them and prints.\n\n2:31:06.320 --> 2:31:11.140\n And so I was thinking to myself, I was like, well, if I just did like a mug with them,\n\n2:31:11.140 --> 2:31:15.260\n well then I could, you know, that could work for what my company does, which is it's a\n\n2:31:15.260 --> 2:31:20.020\n jewelry company and sunglass company, but it could be like an add on kind of deal.\n\n2:31:20.020 --> 2:31:21.260\n These guys are really good designers.\n\n2:31:21.260 --> 2:31:22.260\n I can already tell.\n\n2:31:22.260 --> 2:31:23.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:23.260 --> 2:31:24.260\n I knew you would like this.\n\n2:31:24.260 --> 2:31:25.260\n That's why I brought it.\n\n2:31:25.260 --> 2:31:27.160\n So I'm like, certain people would appreciate this.\n\n2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:33.940\n And so my whole thing, my, my like hashtag is work hard, help harder.\n\n2:31:33.940 --> 2:31:35.820\n And that's the whole concept of what I do now.\n\n2:31:35.820 --> 2:31:38.860\n And so we did a mug and it's called fucking help somebody.\n\n2:31:38.860 --> 2:31:40.340\n That's their like first tag.\n\n2:31:40.340 --> 2:31:47.420\n And then the rest is kindness is a wealth that increases as it is given away.\n\n2:31:47.420 --> 2:31:51.140\n What you get in return isn't passed between hands, but felt between hearts.\n\n2:31:51.140 --> 2:31:55.460\n It's precisely because you've been at the bottom that you can raise others up.\n\n2:31:55.460 --> 2:31:58.940\n It's because you've, sorry, I'm reading a photo here.\n\n2:31:58.940 --> 2:32:00.200\n You've been lost in the dark.\n\n2:32:00.200 --> 2:32:02.460\n You can lead others to the light.\n\n2:32:02.460 --> 2:32:07.860\n It's because you fought with yourself that you can bring peace to someone else.\n\n2:32:07.860 --> 2:32:13.000\n You now have the strength because you've once struggled the best you have to come, the best\n\n2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:16.900\n you have to come from the fucking worst you've had to take.\n\n2:32:16.900 --> 2:32:20.020\n So it's, this is the mug there and we're sold out of them.\n\n2:32:20.020 --> 2:32:21.020\n We just got a bunch of.\n\n2:32:21.020 --> 2:32:22.020\n What does it say?\n\n2:32:22.020 --> 2:32:23.020\n Fucking help.\n\n2:32:23.020 --> 2:32:24.020\n Fucking help somebody.\n\n2:32:24.020 --> 2:32:25.020\n Fucking help somebody.\n\n2:32:25.020 --> 2:32:29.860\n And so we did, they were so gracious enough to sit with me and be like, what do you want\n\n2:32:29.860 --> 2:32:30.900\n the copy to be like?\n\n2:32:30.900 --> 2:32:33.340\n And I said, what do you think I want it to be like?\n\n2:32:33.340 --> 2:32:35.020\n What would you, if you could write one for me, what it'd be?\n\n2:32:35.020 --> 2:32:37.300\n And they're like, it's going to be around lifting people up.\n\n2:32:37.300 --> 2:32:39.020\n And I was like, okay, cool.\n\n2:32:39.020 --> 2:32:40.380\n And they're like, do you want fuck in the title?\n\n2:32:40.380 --> 2:32:43.420\n And I was like, every other word, if we can have it.\n\n2:32:43.420 --> 2:32:44.620\n And they said, we'll just do once.\n\n2:32:44.620 --> 2:32:46.520\n And I was like, okay, I compromise.\n\n2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:49.900\n And so we came up with that copy and we put it on a mug and we're going to be doing a\n\n2:32:49.900 --> 2:32:50.900\n shirt with them.\n\n2:32:50.900 --> 2:32:58.460\n But the, the whole thing to me was that, that embodied what I stand for now and the healing\n\n2:32:58.460 --> 2:33:04.480\n I've gotten to now and the point I've gotten to now in my life, because that fucking sand\n\n2:33:04.480 --> 2:33:10.340\n pit almost broke me, like off the face of the earth broke me.\n\n2:33:10.340 --> 2:33:17.380\n First of all, can we go through the full journey of that in terms of your psychological development?\n\n2:33:17.380 --> 2:33:19.780\n Who were you before?\n\n2:33:19.780 --> 2:33:20.780\n Who were you after?\n\n2:33:20.780 --> 2:33:22.560\n Can you think about that?\n\n2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:29.340\n Like what was your, if you had to put a brain on the table before and after and try to analyze\n\n2:33:29.340 --> 2:33:30.340\n it?\n\n2:33:30.340 --> 2:33:31.340\n Well, they both have CTE.\n\n2:33:31.340 --> 2:33:38.660\n So we know that they're both bruised and gray matter is a little dicey on them.\n\n2:33:38.660 --> 2:33:42.660\n And it may sound the same and it's, it's not, so I'll try to explain it to you.\n\n2:33:42.660 --> 2:33:47.260\n Before that, don't you laugh because I can, I know it's coming.\n\n2:33:47.260 --> 2:33:52.500\n I was even louder, even more obnoxious, even more outgoing.\n\n2:33:52.500 --> 2:33:54.060\n I know it's hard to believe.\n\n2:33:54.060 --> 2:33:57.500\n This is you humble and quiet right now.\n\n2:33:57.500 --> 2:34:01.140\n This is normal me now.\n\n2:34:01.140 --> 2:34:02.180\n This is who I am now.\n\n2:34:02.180 --> 2:34:03.180\n And I love that.\n\n2:34:03.180 --> 2:34:12.460\n But who I was before I was, you know, motocross, taekwondo, tomboy.\n\n2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:14.860\n I didn't know how to dress.\n\n2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:17.940\n I thought that if you just wore like the same jeans and t shirt all the time, that was like\n\n2:34:17.940 --> 2:34:20.340\n acceptable behavior as a woman.\n\n2:34:20.340 --> 2:34:21.900\n I wore skate shoes.\n\n2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:25.540\n I went to a Catholic school that I refused to wear skirt at.\n\n2:34:25.540 --> 2:34:26.540\n I wore pants.\n\n2:34:26.540 --> 2:34:27.780\n I played hacky sack.\n\n2:34:27.780 --> 2:34:32.540\n I was so into sports, I cut and split wood with my dad on weekends.\n\n2:34:32.540 --> 2:34:34.580\n We heated our house that way.\n\n2:34:34.580 --> 2:34:35.820\n I would go on the transport.\n\n2:34:35.820 --> 2:34:42.020\n I stayed out of trouble for the most part.\n\n2:34:42.020 --> 2:34:43.220\n I think I was a fairly good kid.\n\n2:34:43.220 --> 2:34:46.700\n I was pretty angry though for most of my teenage life after my coach.\n\n2:34:46.700 --> 2:34:49.620\n I lost my way a little bit there.\n\n2:34:49.620 --> 2:34:52.620\n I was just crazier.\n\n2:34:52.620 --> 2:34:54.380\n But happy?\n\n2:34:54.380 --> 2:34:55.460\n I don't know if I was happy.\n\n2:34:55.460 --> 2:34:56.880\n I'm realizing that now.\n\n2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:01.900\n I think I was, I think anger overtook who I was, and I think that's why I was such an\n\n2:35:01.900 --> 2:35:04.540\n angry individual towards my parents when I was in high school.\n\n2:35:04.540 --> 2:35:08.820\n So parents, was it a little rough relationship with parents?\n\n2:35:08.820 --> 2:35:09.820\n I mean, yeah.\n\n2:35:09.820 --> 2:35:12.580\n I mean, my dad was gone a couple of weeks at a time.\n\n2:35:12.580 --> 2:35:16.680\n So my mom, stay at home mom, had to handle me and my brother, who were both competitive\n\n2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:19.540\n athletes at the time, by herself.\n\n2:35:19.540 --> 2:35:23.240\n And when you come home and you have a daughter that just calls you like a bitch to your face\n\n2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:29.100\n because she can't, she's being bullied so bad that she can't understand why, but also\n\n2:35:29.100 --> 2:35:34.980\n doesn't know how to fix it, but has no other outlet anymore to kind of get rid of it.\n\n2:35:34.980 --> 2:35:36.020\n I was not nice.\n\n2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:37.260\n I was a really mean person.\n\n2:35:37.260 --> 2:35:38.380\n I broke my mom.\n\n2:35:38.380 --> 2:35:40.260\n I remember the day she stopped yelling.\n\n2:35:40.260 --> 2:35:41.260\n That's the day I know I broke her.\n\n2:35:41.260 --> 2:35:42.260\n I broke her.\n\n2:35:42.260 --> 2:35:44.940\n Did you have a source of discipline in your life?\n\n2:35:44.940 --> 2:35:50.020\n Like, what, like maybe like your dad, somebody who says you're being a bitch.\n\n2:35:50.020 --> 2:35:52.340\n Oh, like who would call me like that?\n\n2:35:52.340 --> 2:35:53.620\n Oh no, no, no, no.\n\n2:35:53.620 --> 2:35:54.620\n My parents were incredible.\n\n2:35:54.620 --> 2:35:58.500\n And my dad came from like a family of like a bajillion kids who lived in a farm with\n\n2:35:58.500 --> 2:36:03.640\n no running water with like super, my dad was brash and abrupt.\n\n2:36:03.640 --> 2:36:05.520\n So like I've caught myself doing that once in a while.\n\n2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:11.460\n So like if I did one thing wrong, if he was just in a mood, I would know it.\n\n2:36:11.460 --> 2:36:13.520\n So you weren't, okay.\n\n2:36:13.520 --> 2:36:15.780\n So that anger just took different forms.\n\n2:36:15.780 --> 2:36:19.820\n It took different forms, but it mostly would be directed at my mom because I know she would\n\n2:36:19.820 --> 2:36:22.600\n take it and that was who I had.\n\n2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:24.420\n And I feel bad about it to the day.\n\n2:36:24.420 --> 2:36:28.060\n Like I still, she listened to the Jocko podcast and so did my dad.\n\n2:36:28.060 --> 2:36:30.700\n And my mom promised me she would never read my book because there's certain parts.\n\n2:36:30.700 --> 2:36:35.340\n I just, my dad on my deployment, when I called him and told him some of the stuff, he started\n\n2:36:35.340 --> 2:36:36.340\n crying.\n\n2:36:36.340 --> 2:36:37.340\n My dad doesn't cry.\n\n2:36:37.340 --> 2:36:40.520\n And he just said, please never tell your mother this.\n\n2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:41.640\n Don't do that to your mom.\n\n2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:44.500\n My mom, like my grandfather came from Hungary.\n\n2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:49.400\n He escaped when the Nazis left, when the Soviets came in.\n\n2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:53.300\n He wasn't great as a dad.\n\n2:36:53.300 --> 2:36:59.860\n My mom went through a lot as a kid and that was because her dad was in the war.\n\n2:36:59.860 --> 2:37:06.480\n That was because her dad didn't know any better and she knew she couldn't be like that.\n\n2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:10.300\n So her way would be yelling.\n\n2:37:10.300 --> 2:37:16.020\n And then I hit about 16 and I wore her down and I broke her, shattered her ability to\n\n2:37:16.020 --> 2:37:20.120\n think that she could have any sort of relationship with me.\n\n2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:22.860\n You wouldn't want to have had a relationship with me.\n\n2:37:22.860 --> 2:37:26.500\n But the funny thing is you've rediscovered that now.\n\n2:37:26.500 --> 2:37:29.300\n So she, is she, are you guys close now?\n\n2:37:29.300 --> 2:37:30.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:37:30.300 --> 2:37:31.820\n She's, she's so funny.\n\n2:37:31.820 --> 2:37:33.340\n She's coming out to help out again.\n\n2:37:33.340 --> 2:37:39.140\n She comes out to help out with Jack all the time and my dad, they're still, they're still\n\n2:37:39.140 --> 2:37:40.140\n truck drivers.\n\n2:37:40.140 --> 2:37:41.140\n They're still on the road.\n\n2:37:41.140 --> 2:37:42.140\n They team drive.\n\n2:37:42.140 --> 2:37:44.100\n They have their little dogs and they go and they do their thing.\n\n2:37:44.100 --> 2:37:48.580\n And I've had that relationship now it's, it's, it's still strenuous.\n\n2:37:48.580 --> 2:37:52.620\n Like I still, when I'm having a hard time, she'll be the person I'll take it out on because\n\n2:37:52.620 --> 2:37:53.980\n I know she can take it.\n\n2:37:53.980 --> 2:37:59.940\n Even though I know I shouldn't, it's like, she's my safe space to be like, blah, about\n\n2:37:59.940 --> 2:38:00.940\n everything.\n\n2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:01.940\n And she'll just be like, well, that's not nice.\n\n2:38:01.940 --> 2:38:03.100\n I'm like, well, you're not, fuck it.\n\n2:38:03.100 --> 2:38:04.860\n Like I, and I'll take it out on her.\n\n2:38:04.860 --> 2:38:11.420\n She knows I don't mean it and I try, um, but for whatever reason, she just, she takes it\n\n2:38:11.420 --> 2:38:12.420\n and um,\n\n2:38:12.420 --> 2:38:13.420\n And it brings it out of you.\n\n2:38:13.420 --> 2:38:14.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:14.420 --> 2:38:20.900\n Can you describe sort of the various characteristics, the, the shape of your PTSD, the trauma, how\n\n2:38:20.900 --> 2:38:28.220\n the anger and hate took shape in you in the, in the seconds, minutes, hours, months, years\n\n2:38:28.220 --> 2:38:33.980\n after and after the, the full trauma of all the things you've experienced in Afghanistan.\n\n2:38:33.980 --> 2:38:37.620\n So it's funny because Jocko asked me something and it made me, it's made me, I've really\n\n2:38:37.620 --> 2:38:42.620\n been thinking a lot about it and he's like, do you think if somebody of the leadership\n\n2:38:42.620 --> 2:38:50.540\n would have just sat you down and said, Hey, Burns, what you're feeling is okay, what you're\n\n2:38:50.540 --> 2:38:56.380\n feeling is normal, what you're feeling is what happens when you're in something like\n\n2:38:56.380 --> 2:38:57.380\n this.\n\n2:38:57.380 --> 2:38:58.380\n Do you think you would be where you are?\n\n2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:02.300\n And I said, well, I thought about it and I'm like, you know, I don't think I would\n\n2:39:02.300 --> 2:39:05.660\n be because I wouldn't have been medicated out of my mind.\n\n2:39:05.660 --> 2:39:10.220\n I wasn't able to process anything because I was just given medication right from the\n\n2:39:10.220 --> 2:39:11.220\n get.\n\n2:39:11.220 --> 2:39:17.020\n And for me, what happened was once that light switch was off, um, I was sent back to Kandahar\n\n2:39:17.020 --> 2:39:22.420\n to what I, once the operation was over, we, we flew back to Kandahar, like with the Brits.\n\n2:39:22.420 --> 2:39:26.900\n And then because there was deaths and we lost people on that operation, I had to go to the\n\n2:39:26.900 --> 2:39:33.180\n British side for the next, I think three or four days and recant word for word why, what\n\n2:39:33.180 --> 2:39:37.780\n happened to a British MP who hand wrote statements, but we had to do that on repeat to make sure\n\n2:39:37.780 --> 2:39:42.460\n we all had the same story and so nobody shot anybody in the back.\n\n2:39:42.460 --> 2:39:47.740\n And so that I don't think is a great way to do that after an after action, after action\n\n2:39:47.740 --> 2:39:52.860\n reports happen, but I don't think beating a dead horse and having somebody repeat, repeat,\n\n2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:55.420\n repeat, and then just imprint more and more and more.\n\n2:39:55.420 --> 2:39:58.260\n I don't, I don't know that that is a great way of doing that.\n\n2:39:58.260 --> 2:39:59.260\n Um,\n\n2:39:59.260 --> 2:40:04.580\n And especially from a perspective of what are they, uh, liability almost like legal,\n\n2:40:04.580 --> 2:40:08.780\n that kind of that perspective as opposed to the full perspective.\n\n2:40:08.780 --> 2:40:15.740\n I mean, so, so for people who don't know, uh, one is the, the, the overmedication and\n\n2:40:15.740 --> 2:40:18.300\n that you had to undergo.\n\n2:40:18.300 --> 2:40:24.980\n And then the other is the social isolation in terms of, I mean, more than what Jaco,\n\n2:40:24.980 --> 2:40:31.660\n what you just mentioned, you also kind of, uh, mentioned that just being with, um, with\n\n2:40:31.660 --> 2:40:37.660\n other soldiers you're close with, just sitting there in silence and, um, just sitting in\n\n2:40:37.660 --> 2:40:45.500\n that shared understanding, even that in itself communicates like these feelings are normal.\n\n2:40:45.500 --> 2:40:51.860\n Like you don't have to talk and you were robbed of that as well, essentially.\n\n2:40:51.860 --> 2:40:52.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:52.860 --> 2:40:56.100\n Because I was, because I was borrowed, I think Jaco had a name for us when we get borrowed.\n\n2:40:56.100 --> 2:40:59.300\n It was like, there was like a, I don't know what they call us, but it's like when you\n\n2:40:59.300 --> 2:41:01.660\n take a person and you put them in another unit, there's a name for it.\n\n2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:03.180\n I don't remember what it was.\n\n2:41:03.180 --> 2:41:05.380\n You never see those people again.\n\n2:41:05.380 --> 2:41:10.060\n But because I was in Kanderhart, the doctors gave me the medication because I, I think\n\n2:41:10.060 --> 2:41:12.140\n I was the one who said, I don't, this isn't right.\n\n2:41:12.140 --> 2:41:13.140\n I don't feel right.\n\n2:41:13.140 --> 2:41:14.140\n This is wrong.\n\n2:41:14.140 --> 2:41:17.420\n Cause when I got back that night, there was supposed to be somebody there to pick me up,\n\n2:41:17.420 --> 2:41:20.300\n to take me to the other side of the base and no one showed.\n\n2:41:20.300 --> 2:41:26.620\n So I, I humped on my kit back to the Canada house and I remember getting in the shower\n\n2:41:26.620 --> 2:41:32.660\n and the rule was quick fucking showers, no water.\n\n2:41:32.660 --> 2:41:37.980\n I must've sat on that floor, that shower for half an hour, 45 minutes.\n\n2:41:37.980 --> 2:41:41.420\n I just held myself and cried and didn't even know why I was crying.\n\n2:41:41.420 --> 2:41:50.820\n I just knew I needed to cry and I still this day, I, and when they sent me back to the\n\n2:41:50.820 --> 2:41:58.260\n FOB, they sent me back with all this medication after spending that time with the Brits and\n\n2:41:58.260 --> 2:42:01.340\n they put me back on the guns, medicated out of my fucking tree.\n\n2:42:01.340 --> 2:42:07.060\n I almost shot someone, but they didn't tell my staff that I was on meds.\n\n2:42:07.060 --> 2:42:11.340\n So when the artillery gun was going off and I didn't run to the gun and I was still asleep\n\n2:42:11.340 --> 2:42:16.940\n inside the tent with the gun beside my head, they didn't know I was just drugged.\n\n2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:20.180\n They just thought I was fucking off somewhere, hanging out with some Americans.\n\n2:42:20.180 --> 2:42:24.060\n They just thought I wasn't doing any of what I should be doing.\n\n2:42:24.060 --> 2:42:28.740\n And then I remember the moment my Sergeant, we did a night shoot and he, he's so funny\n\n2:42:28.740 --> 2:42:33.700\n because he called me and goes, ah, fuck, Burns, I remember this, yes, you were standing there\n\n2:42:33.700 --> 2:42:37.900\n with me and I look at you and go, hey, Burns, are you okay?\n\n2:42:37.900 --> 2:42:42.340\n Because your eyes are all fucked.\n\n2:42:42.340 --> 2:42:46.740\n And I, I looked at Sergeant LeBlanc and I just remember going, yeah, I'm good.\n\n2:42:46.740 --> 2:42:47.740\n Like just huh.\n\n2:42:47.740 --> 2:42:51.060\n He's like, I still remember that.\n\n2:42:51.060 --> 2:42:52.060\n And I'm like, I know.\n\n2:42:52.060 --> 2:42:56.420\n And he goes, they never tell me anything, fuck, Burns, I did not know the drugs you\n\n2:42:56.420 --> 2:42:57.420\n were on.\n\n2:42:57.420 --> 2:43:01.980\n And as I was on all of them, he goes, I know I walk in, you show me the bottles, ah, fuck,\n\n2:43:01.980 --> 2:43:05.300\n Burns, you shouldn't have been there.\n\n2:43:05.300 --> 2:43:06.780\n I guarantee he sounds just like that.\n\n2:43:06.780 --> 2:43:07.780\n You'll find out.\n\n2:43:07.780 --> 2:43:08.780\n He's brilliant.\n\n2:43:08.780 --> 2:43:09.780\n He's brilliant.\n\n2:43:09.780 --> 2:43:19.540\n Yeah, so what, I mean, I suppose this is a lazy way of dealing with trauma and it's for\n\n2:43:19.540 --> 2:43:21.540\n the military in some sense.\n\n2:43:21.540 --> 2:43:25.580\n If you don't have a good program in place, this makes sense, but you should have a good\n\n2:43:25.580 --> 2:43:26.580\n program in place.\n\n2:43:26.580 --> 2:43:32.540\n Just like you said, on the prep, on the mental prep side, like just any prep, like training\n\n2:43:32.540 --> 2:43:38.660\n people, training people on the, I suppose to, I guess train the fact that you're going\n\n2:43:38.660 --> 2:43:45.020\n to have somebody close to you blow up, like you have to probably visualize that.\n\n2:43:45.020 --> 2:43:46.020\n You have to think through that.\n\n2:43:46.020 --> 2:43:50.620\n You have to have a process of how to deal with something like that, with that kind of\n\n2:43:50.620 --> 2:43:51.620\n trauma.\n\n2:43:51.620 --> 2:43:52.620\n And then that's it.\n\n2:43:52.620 --> 2:43:54.620\n Tools in the toolbox is what the doctors call it.\n\n2:43:54.620 --> 2:43:55.620\n Exactly.\n\n2:43:55.620 --> 2:43:58.140\n I mean, and it's not like weakness, it's actually strength.\n\n2:43:58.140 --> 2:44:04.040\n It's like you have to be mentally strong enough to process that.\n\n2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:09.500\n That probably takes a lot of training, but it's a great training, right?\n\n2:44:09.500 --> 2:44:13.020\n Well worth it to protect your investment training.\n\n2:44:13.020 --> 2:44:14.020\n Right.\n\n2:44:14.020 --> 2:44:16.660\n That's a very cold, but correct way to put it.\n\n2:44:16.660 --> 2:44:17.660\n I mean, it's cold.\n\n2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:22.420\n I thought you would appreciate the coldness of the way I articulated that.\n\n2:44:22.420 --> 2:44:23.420\n Well, yeah.\n\n2:44:23.420 --> 2:44:25.540\n I mean, I'm of two minds in this.\n\n2:44:25.540 --> 2:44:32.500\n I don't, I sometimes wonder like what I would be like as a soldier, actually.\n\n2:44:32.500 --> 2:44:36.460\n I don't know, because I love country and I love all the things you're mentioning.\n\n2:44:36.460 --> 2:44:42.060\n Like I could see myself probably dying for my country and also enjoying the skill of\n\n2:44:42.060 --> 2:44:43.060\n it.\n\n2:44:43.060 --> 2:44:48.020\n The very like OCD, like very proficient.\n\n2:44:48.020 --> 2:44:49.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:49.020 --> 2:44:53.340\n But then also the human side, I fall in love with people.\n\n2:44:53.340 --> 2:44:54.540\n I fall in love with everything.\n\n2:44:54.540 --> 2:45:00.420\n So I don't know, I suppose you have to shut off the part of your brain when you're executing\n\n2:45:00.420 --> 2:45:09.780\n a mission that cares about other humans outside your close knit group.\n\n2:45:09.780 --> 2:45:11.900\n Like there's no time for philosophical thinking.\n\n2:45:11.900 --> 2:45:12.900\n I don't know.\n\n2:45:12.900 --> 2:45:15.380\n I suppose that's why it's better to be young.\n\n2:45:15.380 --> 2:45:17.700\n Young and dumb.\n\n2:45:17.700 --> 2:45:19.300\n You're not necessarily dumb.\n\n2:45:19.300 --> 2:45:27.580\n It's just like you were over that energy of excitement of proficiency and excellence is\n\n2:45:27.580 --> 2:45:30.380\n just higher than it is later in life.\n\n2:45:30.380 --> 2:45:32.660\n You're not dumb.\n\n2:45:32.660 --> 2:45:46.540\n I was not dumb, but I was naive, uneducated, not well trained and had an arrogance because\n\n2:45:46.540 --> 2:45:49.300\n we were told we were the fucking shit.\n\n2:45:49.300 --> 2:45:50.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:45:50.300 --> 2:45:51.300\n You're amazing.\n\n2:45:51.300 --> 2:45:52.300\n Okay.\n\n2:45:52.300 --> 2:45:53.300\n I'm amazing.\n\n2:45:53.300 --> 2:45:56.380\n So I wonder, do they think if we do mental training?\n\n2:45:56.380 --> 2:45:57.540\n That makes you weak.\n\n2:45:57.540 --> 2:46:00.260\n Do you think the military thinks that makes you weak?\n\n2:46:00.260 --> 2:46:01.260\n Well, yes.\n\n2:46:01.260 --> 2:46:05.780\n And the reason I can say that is because it's obvious in the way that they handle it now.\n\n2:46:05.780 --> 2:46:09.540\n So like if a soldier says, hey, I'm really struggling with that last op we were on, man,\n\n2:46:09.540 --> 2:46:13.620\n it's just really, it's getting to me, I'm having a hard time sleeping.\n\n2:46:13.620 --> 2:46:19.740\n They're going to go, okay, well, how, how hard of a time sleeping are you having?\n\n2:46:19.740 --> 2:46:22.780\n And then you get that re and you go, oh no, I'm not, it's not that bad.\n\n2:46:22.780 --> 2:46:24.580\n I'm not, I don't need anything for it.\n\n2:46:24.580 --> 2:46:26.420\n Like I'm just like once in a while I'm losing some sleep.\n\n2:46:26.420 --> 2:46:27.420\n They're like, okay.\n\n2:46:27.420 --> 2:46:31.340\n Because you know that pen moves, it's all getting written down and then you're dead\n\n2:46:31.340 --> 2:46:33.580\n red, you're dead red, which means you're not deploying again.\n\n2:46:33.580 --> 2:46:34.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:34.580 --> 2:46:36.660\n And then you're not able to do the thing you love the most with the people you love the\n\n2:46:36.660 --> 2:46:37.660\n most.\n\n2:46:37.660 --> 2:46:38.660\n Right.\n\n2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:44.100\n I mean, but also this is really difficult and I'd love to talk to you about PTSD, but\n\n2:46:44.100 --> 2:46:45.100\n like.\n\n2:46:45.100 --> 2:46:46.100\n Sorry.\n\n2:46:46.100 --> 2:46:47.100\n Yes.\n\n2:46:47.100 --> 2:46:48.100\n I keep going off.\n\n2:46:48.100 --> 2:46:49.100\n No, please.\n\n2:46:49.100 --> 2:47:01.260\n So I'm, I'm hoping to, um, like launch a company, you know, in the engineering space and the,\n\n2:47:01.260 --> 2:47:08.980\n and I currently lead, I've led a few people and it's always this kind of, um, like how\n\n2:47:08.980 --> 2:47:14.420\n much are you supposed to push people because people are, everyone is weak and lazy.\n\n2:47:14.420 --> 2:47:17.540\n Are you quoting her text messages from earlier?\n\n2:47:17.540 --> 2:47:18.540\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:47:18.540 --> 2:47:21.180\n I'm quoting, all I have is just quotes from you.\n\n2:47:21.180 --> 2:47:22.180\n That's okay.\n\n2:47:22.180 --> 2:47:26.540\n Uh, tells me how much we've spoken in the past week, poor soul.\n\n2:47:26.540 --> 2:47:31.580\n I just, I don't know what to do because sometimes people are really struggling, like really\n\n2:47:31.580 --> 2:47:34.140\n struggling in a way with their being there.\n\n2:47:34.140 --> 2:47:39.580\n Like it's the, it's the Goggins thing is like, where's the line to where you're actually\n\n2:47:39.580 --> 2:47:45.780\n breaking the human being versus where you're breaking them at the places where they will\n\n2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:47.820\n grow back stronger.\n\n2:47:47.820 --> 2:47:52.300\n Like in that line is tricky, uh, to, to truly understand.\n\n2:47:52.300 --> 2:47:58.820\n I think the military eras on the side of like, they, you know, like push them beyond all\n\n2:47:58.820 --> 2:48:03.940\n limits, physical, physical, but mental, they don't, they need to respect the mental more.\n\n2:48:03.940 --> 2:48:06.100\n Uh, they fuck with the brain a little bit.\n\n2:48:06.100 --> 2:48:09.460\n I mean, in basic training, they like scream in your face and to see who's going to crack\n\n2:48:09.460 --> 2:48:13.740\n and they, they put you on sleep deprivation to see who's weak enough that they can't handle\n\n2:48:13.740 --> 2:48:14.740\n sleep depth.\n\n2:48:14.740 --> 2:48:16.300\n They'll, they do stuff to you.\n\n2:48:16.300 --> 2:48:20.420\n Like I know if you're a downed pilot, you have to go and you have to do this training\n\n2:48:20.420 --> 2:48:22.300\n and like it's, you'll get captured.\n\n2:48:22.300 --> 2:48:27.920\n It's like this whole thing and they fuck with your brain, but there's a line.\n\n2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:29.680\n There's a line.\n\n2:48:29.680 --> 2:48:37.420\n My issue is go to the line, cross the line, give them the tools to come back from the\n\n2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:38.420\n line.\n\n2:48:38.420 --> 2:48:39.420\n Right.\n\n2:48:39.420 --> 2:48:40.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:48:40.420 --> 2:48:41.420\n We don't do that.\n\n2:48:41.420 --> 2:48:43.400\n We don't, we, we know there's PTSD.\n\n2:48:43.400 --> 2:48:44.980\n We know there's a, such a thing.\n\n2:48:44.980 --> 2:48:46.540\n We understand there's anxiety and depression.\n\n2:48:46.540 --> 2:48:48.140\n We understand there's major depressive disorder.\n\n2:48:48.140 --> 2:48:51.140\n We understand that there are precursors.\n\n2:48:51.140 --> 2:48:52.400\n There are signs and symptoms.\n\n2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:54.340\n We understand that.\n\n2:48:54.340 --> 2:49:00.860\n So why are we not building enough of a toolkit, whether that be, I'm not talking medication.\n\n2:49:00.860 --> 2:49:06.260\n I'm talking, it sounds woo woo, but fucking trust me, it works.\n\n2:49:06.260 --> 2:49:08.280\n I'm talking meditation.\n\n2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:09.820\n I'm talking yoga.\n\n2:49:09.820 --> 2:49:11.980\n I'm talking about peer group support.\n\n2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:16.800\n I'm talking about if you go to your doctor and report this, there's, you're not automatically\n\n2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:18.980\n going to be losing your job.\n\n2:49:18.980 --> 2:49:22.340\n Why aren't we giving the proper tools and the education needed?\n\n2:49:22.340 --> 2:49:24.760\n These things are not difficult to teach.\n\n2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:26.100\n They don't take a lot of time.\n\n2:49:26.100 --> 2:49:27.560\n They don't take a lot of money.\n\n2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:30.440\n The only time it takes a lot of money is when you want to medicate.\n\n2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:32.500\n We don't need to medicate you yet.\n\n2:49:32.500 --> 2:49:35.820\n You only need to be medicated if you're a danger to someone else or yourself.\n\n2:49:35.820 --> 2:49:39.440\n And most of the time, because of the way the system is set, you'll lie about it through\n\n2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:42.660\n your fucking teeth, just so that no one touches you.\n\n2:49:42.660 --> 2:49:47.620\n So from the perspective of the military, do you think you can still be a bad motherfucker\n\n2:49:47.620 --> 2:49:50.060\n and do all the mental work?\n\n2:49:50.060 --> 2:49:51.060\n Yes.\n\n2:49:51.060 --> 2:49:55.820\n Some of the baddest dudes I've ever known are like, I gotta go to yoga.\n\n2:49:55.820 --> 2:49:57.780\n I gotta go meditate.\n\n2:49:57.780 --> 2:49:59.380\n I go do ayah with those guys.\n\n2:49:59.380 --> 2:50:00.380\n Why?\n\n2:50:00.380 --> 2:50:04.980\n Because they know that that's not okay to be like that in your life.\n\n2:50:04.980 --> 2:50:10.140\n Can you answer the ridiculously big question of what is PTSD?\n\n2:50:10.140 --> 2:50:13.860\n Do you understand the basic characteristics of it?\n\n2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:20.500\n Is there universal characteristics from your own unique experience, from what you've understood\n\n2:50:20.500 --> 2:50:21.500\n about it?\n\n2:50:21.500 --> 2:50:22.500\n Yeah, of course there are.\n\n2:50:22.500 --> 2:50:27.460\n So there's the basic things that a doctor looks for when they're diagnosing PTSD.\n\n2:50:27.460 --> 2:50:28.460\n I'm not a doctor.\n\n2:50:28.460 --> 2:50:30.100\n Let me make that fucking clear.\n\n2:50:30.100 --> 2:50:32.320\n But there are things that you look for.\n\n2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:34.060\n You look for insomnia.\n\n2:50:34.060 --> 2:50:36.100\n You look for anger and aggression.\n\n2:50:36.100 --> 2:50:38.260\n You look for people to fly off the handle.\n\n2:50:38.260 --> 2:50:40.700\n You look for avoidance.\n\n2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:42.820\n You can tell in somebody's body.\n\n2:50:42.820 --> 2:50:43.820\n People who can't sleep.\n\n2:50:43.820 --> 2:50:47.500\n If you can't sleep, you know that after a certain amount of time, they're just going\n\n2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:49.540\n to deteriorate.\n\n2:50:49.540 --> 2:50:51.540\n You know, sleeplessness, triggers.\n\n2:50:51.540 --> 2:50:54.020\n When you say avoidance, do you mean...\n\n2:50:54.020 --> 2:50:55.020\n Avoidance.\n\n2:50:55.020 --> 2:50:58.980\n So like, when I first got back to Canada, I avoided everybody that was Middle Eastern\n\n2:50:58.980 --> 2:51:03.320\n at all costs, no matter how much of a difference it made in my day.\n\n2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:07.100\n If I had to not go somewhere for one of the greatest events of my life, I wouldn't have\n\n2:51:07.100 --> 2:51:08.100\n went.\n\n2:51:08.100 --> 2:51:11.540\n But isn't there some aspect that are combined with the triggers?\n\n2:51:11.540 --> 2:51:16.060\n Maybe it's wise to avoid triggers even like for your own personal health, well being.\n\n2:51:16.060 --> 2:51:17.060\n Well that's it.\n\n2:51:17.060 --> 2:51:19.060\n For me, that was one of my triggers.\n\n2:51:19.060 --> 2:51:20.740\n So you have triggers.\n\n2:51:20.740 --> 2:51:24.500\n And then you also deal with things like sounds and smells.\n\n2:51:24.500 --> 2:51:25.500\n You can tell.\n\n2:51:25.500 --> 2:51:26.700\n You can tell when someone's triggered.\n\n2:51:26.700 --> 2:51:28.660\n A lot of vets don't like fireworks.\n\n2:51:28.660 --> 2:51:31.620\n It's like, okay, well remove yourself from the situation.\n\n2:51:31.620 --> 2:51:39.620\n So there's other things within PTSD that kind of rear its head that with PTSD kind of attach\n\n2:51:39.620 --> 2:51:40.620\n other things.\n\n2:51:40.620 --> 2:51:43.580\n So like when I was diagnosed with PTSD, I think it was like four years later, I was\n\n2:51:43.580 --> 2:51:46.200\n diagnosed with major depressive disorder.\n\n2:51:46.200 --> 2:51:50.800\n And that was kind of a compilation of things that was just like a shit show there.\n\n2:51:50.800 --> 2:51:52.300\n What is major depressive disorder?\n\n2:51:52.300 --> 2:51:53.300\n Good question.\n\n2:51:53.300 --> 2:51:56.060\n Is there an answer?\n\n2:51:56.060 --> 2:51:57.060\n I don't have one.\n\n2:51:57.060 --> 2:51:58.980\n I was told I had it.\n\n2:51:58.980 --> 2:52:05.180\n Okay, so I mean, what does your mind go through?\n\n2:52:05.180 --> 2:52:10.820\n Where are the places that my mind goes, your mind goes like the dark places when I get\n\n2:52:10.820 --> 2:52:12.980\n triggered and when it was like really bad?\n\n2:52:12.980 --> 2:52:13.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:13.980 --> 2:52:14.980\n Okay.\n\n2:52:14.980 --> 2:52:15.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:15.980 --> 2:52:20.140\n So you thought about suicide every minute of every day.\n\n2:52:20.140 --> 2:52:23.500\n What are the pros of suicide in your mind at that time?\n\n2:52:23.500 --> 2:52:29.740\n At that time, the pros were no one has to deal with this anymore, I don't have to feel\n\n2:52:29.740 --> 2:52:37.500\n this way anymore, I'm a burden to my family, I'm a burden to the military system, I'm weak,\n\n2:52:37.500 --> 2:52:44.100\n I'm a bad soldier, I didn't do my job, I don't deserve to be alive, I don't deserve veterans\n\n2:52:44.100 --> 2:52:49.740\n affairs support, my parents don't deserve to watch me go through this, the guy I was\n\n2:52:49.740 --> 2:52:56.060\n dating didn't deserve to put up with the bullshit I put him through, the people who drive with\n\n2:52:56.060 --> 2:53:02.980\n me in cars didn't deserve to almost hit medians because I swerved because of a piece of garbage,\n\n2:53:02.980 --> 2:53:08.220\n people didn't deserve my racist outburst, people didn't deserve, people didn't, I did\n\n2:53:08.220 --> 2:53:10.260\n not deserve to be breathing anymore.\n\n2:53:10.260 --> 2:53:15.060\n I should have died there and I wished I died there.\n\n2:53:15.060 --> 2:53:17.820\n So self hate there too.\n\n2:53:17.820 --> 2:53:30.380\n So that's at the core of it, that's like this, so how do you escape from that place?\n\n2:53:30.380 --> 2:53:39.420\n How do you overcome that depression essentially at the core of the desire to kill yourself?\n\n2:53:39.420 --> 2:53:46.540\n What basic principles, I mean, we could talk about ayahuasca, but basic principles of literally\n\n2:53:46.540 --> 2:53:48.380\n how do you escape that moment?\n\n2:53:48.380 --> 2:53:53.460\n Yeah, previous to any of that, I did from 2009, I got out, so I was medically, I was\n\n2:53:53.460 --> 2:54:00.100\n 3B medical honorable discharge in 2011, May 23rd, 2011, so I left the military then.\n\n2:54:00.100 --> 2:54:04.780\n And so it's been 10 years, just over 10 years, oh my God, it's 10 and a half years, I just\n\n2:54:04.780 --> 2:54:05.780\n realized that right now.\n\n2:54:05.780 --> 2:54:06.780\n Oh my God.\n\n2:54:06.780 --> 2:54:07.780\n Happy anniversary.\n\n2:54:07.780 --> 2:54:08.780\n Thanks, man.\n\n2:54:08.780 --> 2:54:09.780\n Awesome.\n\n2:54:09.780 --> 2:54:14.980\n So I've been out for 10 years and I would say the reason I didn't kill myself for the\n\n2:54:14.980 --> 2:54:18.900\n longest time was the individual I was dating.\n\n2:54:18.900 --> 2:54:22.260\n That was straight across the board, that was it.\n\n2:54:22.260 --> 2:54:31.340\n For me, there was no relief for about six years of the thought of just kill yourself,\n\n2:54:31.340 --> 2:54:32.340\n kill yourself, kill yourself.\n\n2:54:32.340 --> 2:54:33.340\n It's easier if you just do it.\n\n2:54:33.340 --> 2:54:36.780\n That voice was so strong for that long, there was really no relief.\n\n2:54:36.780 --> 2:54:44.220\n What there was though was implementation of different medications, realizing they weren't\n\n2:54:44.220 --> 2:54:49.540\n working, trying different things, getting myself to a point where I could leave my house\n\n2:54:49.540 --> 2:54:54.980\n comfortably ish again, and I wasn't triggered, which then allowed me to travel, which then\n\n2:54:54.980 --> 2:54:59.900\n allowed me to slowly try to go back to school, which by the way, it was a very bad idea.\n\n2:54:59.900 --> 2:55:02.740\n That was a bad idea, that was bad.\n\n2:55:02.740 --> 2:55:08.180\n I went too early, they started practicing active shooter drills in our school.\n\n2:55:08.180 --> 2:55:11.700\n It was bad, my professors understood.\n\n2:55:11.700 --> 2:55:14.100\n School was full of triggers, it turns out.\n\n2:55:14.100 --> 2:55:16.980\n It is when you live in Vancouver.\n\n2:55:16.980 --> 2:55:20.900\n There's a theme to this conversation about your love for Canada.\n\n2:55:20.900 --> 2:55:25.940\n Look at me, I love my fucking country, I am one of the most patriotic people you will\n\n2:55:25.940 --> 2:55:26.940\n meet in it.\n\n2:55:26.940 --> 2:55:31.740\n I think Canada is one of the greatest fucking places on the earth.\n\n2:55:31.740 --> 2:55:38.860\n I think in the past two years or three years, I have seen what I loved so deeply, so proudly\n\n2:55:38.860 --> 2:55:50.380\n preached about so...\n\n2:55:50.380 --> 2:55:55.060\n I'm so proud of what I did there.\n\n2:55:55.060 --> 2:56:04.260\n And I'm so proud of the country I got to represent, because I was good at my job.\n\n2:56:04.260 --> 2:56:08.940\n Being great at your job for a country you love, you just don't like some of the politicians\n\n2:56:08.940 --> 2:56:09.940\n some of the time.\n\n2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:14.620\n It's not even the politicians anymore, it's the state of the country.\n\n2:56:14.620 --> 2:56:17.760\n I'm a second class citizen in my own country right now.\n\n2:56:17.760 --> 2:56:21.220\n I can't travel to see my parents within my own country.\n\n2:56:21.220 --> 2:56:24.740\n I'm not allowed to step foot in my son's school.\n\n2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:29.100\n I am not allowed to go to a restaurant with my family.\n\n2:56:29.100 --> 2:56:34.620\n I'm not allowed to leave Canada without, I told you all the stuff I have to do to get\n\n2:56:34.620 --> 2:56:35.620\n here.\n\n2:56:35.620 --> 2:56:38.300\n To even get home, I have to do the same.\n\n2:56:38.300 --> 2:56:44.900\n I'm watched by the RCMP, neighbors rat you out.\n\n2:56:44.900 --> 2:56:47.300\n So for somebody who fought for their country.\n\n2:56:47.300 --> 2:56:50.100\n I hate it, it makes me so sad.\n\n2:56:50.100 --> 2:56:56.060\n To go through this process of what many consider to be power overreach by government in the\n\n2:56:56.060 --> 2:57:00.620\n face of this particular pandemic.\n\n2:57:00.620 --> 2:57:05.140\n I always knew I had a hard time, I loved Canada, the day I got spit on when I got home was\n\n2:57:05.140 --> 2:57:06.140\n not ideal.\n\n2:57:06.140 --> 2:57:17.260\n But the thing was, I knew long enough that if I just put one foot in front of the other\n\n2:57:17.260 --> 2:57:23.580\n and kept going to treatment, and kept doing what my doctor told me to do, that I could\n\n2:57:23.580 --> 2:57:26.980\n pull out of this if I tried.\n\n2:57:26.980 --> 2:57:29.820\n I was told that I could do anything in my life.\n\n2:57:29.820 --> 2:57:31.460\n It didn't matter.\n\n2:57:31.460 --> 2:57:32.980\n As long as I tried.\n\n2:57:32.980 --> 2:57:36.100\n Was trying really hard?\n\n2:57:36.100 --> 2:57:41.700\n Trying was harder than breathing.\n\n2:57:41.700 --> 2:57:42.980\n It was exhausting.\n\n2:57:42.980 --> 2:57:50.780\n It was, I would be awake for like half a day and every minute of that day, I'd just stare\n\n2:57:50.780 --> 2:57:53.940\n at the wall and just want to kill myself.\n\n2:57:53.940 --> 2:58:00.220\n That's what I've had people close to me who suffer from depression and it was like, it's\n\n2:58:00.220 --> 2:58:06.180\n unclear how to escape, but it's clear that you need to try something.\n\n2:58:06.180 --> 2:58:07.940\n And they didn't want to even try.\n\n2:58:07.940 --> 2:58:10.940\n Because you have no try in you.\n\n2:58:10.940 --> 2:58:18.340\n I'm watching a person who has no energy essentially to like do any of it and it's like so hopeless.\n\n2:58:18.340 --> 2:58:23.260\n But you have to try and I think some of that has to do with all the different physical\n\n2:58:23.260 --> 2:58:24.260\n feeds you have to do.\n\n2:58:24.260 --> 2:58:27.380\n Like when you have nothing left, you still keep going.\n\n2:58:27.380 --> 2:58:33.580\n That same like weird drive when you're empty, you still keep going.\n\n2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:34.580\n I wanted to give up.\n\n2:58:34.580 --> 2:58:35.580\n I tried.\n\n2:58:35.580 --> 2:58:37.660\n It's, I did.\n\n2:58:37.660 --> 2:58:42.900\n I'm really lucky because it really was the one person that I'd wake up to next every\n\n2:58:42.900 --> 2:58:47.700\n day and he'd be like, hey, so that new drug you're on?\n\n2:58:47.700 --> 2:58:51.220\n Fun fact, if you don't go to sleep right away, you talk and when you talk, you just don't\n\n2:58:51.220 --> 2:58:56.580\n fucking stop and you go off about everything that's horrible and I'm like, what are you\n\n2:58:56.580 --> 2:58:57.580\n talking about?\n\n2:58:57.580 --> 2:58:58.580\n No, last night.\n\n2:58:58.580 --> 2:58:59.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:59.580 --> 2:59:00.580\n You took that pill.\n\n2:59:00.580 --> 2:59:01.580\n Guess what?\n\n2:59:01.580 --> 2:59:02.580\n You just, you just, you didn't stop.\n\n2:59:02.580 --> 2:59:03.580\n I'm like, I have no recollection.\n\n2:59:03.580 --> 2:59:04.580\n I'd get up in the middle of the night.\n\n2:59:04.580 --> 2:59:11.580\n I would cook food like on a stove and it would be, hopefully we don't die because I would\n\n2:59:11.580 --> 2:59:14.780\n have no recollection because of the drugs.\n\n2:59:14.780 --> 2:59:21.060\n The idea that when people say, well, just put yourself out of depression, I'm a highly\n\n2:59:21.060 --> 2:59:25.860\n motivated individual.\n\n2:59:25.860 --> 2:59:32.620\n The idea of lifting my head up to turnover was daunting.\n\n2:59:32.620 --> 2:59:33.620\n It's terrifying.\n\n2:59:33.620 --> 2:59:39.340\n It's like for somebody so as driven as you to completely lose all of that for moments\n\n2:59:39.340 --> 2:59:43.420\n of time, for stretches of time.\n\n2:59:43.420 --> 2:59:45.100\n Fuck the mind is a motherfucker.\n\n2:59:45.100 --> 2:59:46.100\n It is.\n\n2:59:46.100 --> 2:59:54.260\n I can't, for somebody like, I can't, I can't, I'm so, I'm so grateful for people like you\n\n2:59:54.260 --> 2:59:56.540\n to be able to pull out of that.\n\n2:59:56.540 --> 2:59:58.980\n I've been always the opposite.\n\n2:59:58.980 --> 3:00:06.460\n Like I've been very fortunate to just always find joy, meaning in everything, even the\n\n3:00:06.460 --> 3:00:07.460\n stupidest shit.\n\n3:00:07.460 --> 3:00:08.940\n Can I ask you something?\n\n3:00:08.940 --> 3:00:09.940\n Yeah.\n\n3:00:09.940 --> 3:00:16.020\n Do you think that's because of how you were raised, where you came from?\n\n3:00:16.020 --> 3:00:19.340\n No, no, it was my own person.\n\n3:00:19.340 --> 3:00:27.380\n I honestly think it's the biology, the, this, cause I had my parents, I'm very cognizant\n\n3:00:27.380 --> 3:00:30.460\n of had nothing to do with that.\n\n3:00:30.460 --> 3:00:33.460\n They, they never understood this little engine I had.\n\n3:00:33.460 --> 3:00:37.740\n I just, I always liked just sitting, looking at people and just enjoying how amazing they\n\n3:00:37.740 --> 3:00:42.500\n are and just like looking at, like it's, I think it's straight up just biology, whatever\n\n3:00:42.500 --> 3:00:44.220\n the neurochemistry is.\n\n3:00:44.220 --> 3:00:50.100\n Like I'm just getting like a good drug from, yeah, I'm getting hits all the time from stupid\n\n3:00:50.100 --> 3:00:51.100\n shit.\n\n3:00:51.100 --> 3:00:58.180\n And it doesn't, and yeah, so that's why I can be, sometimes I'll talk like very self\n\n3:00:58.180 --> 3:01:03.420\n critically about myself because that's almost makes me, it makes life more fun and challenges\n\n3:01:03.420 --> 3:01:05.180\n stuff and it makes you more productive.\n\n3:01:05.180 --> 3:01:09.140\n But ultimately it's because I'm getting that like good, I'm getting the good stuff all\n\n3:01:09.140 --> 3:01:10.140\n the time.\n\n3:01:10.140 --> 3:01:11.140\n I wondered about that.\n\n3:01:11.140 --> 3:01:14.340\n I was thinking about that when I listened to you for the first time on, I think when\n\n3:01:14.340 --> 3:01:17.380\n you're on Rogan for the first time, water shouldn't do that.\n\n3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:19.180\n Oh, it's not water.\n\n3:01:19.180 --> 3:01:20.180\n You shouldn't trust.\n\n3:01:20.180 --> 3:01:21.180\n See, this is the thing with the Russians.\n\n3:01:21.180 --> 3:01:22.180\n It's Dessani.\n\n3:01:22.180 --> 3:01:23.180\n It's owned by Coca Cola.\n\n3:01:23.180 --> 3:01:26.140\n Well, no, I had it resealed.\n\n3:01:26.140 --> 3:01:30.980\n I mean, I didn't go that far, but now I'm really certain to question what's in this,\n\n3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:31.980\n but that's okay.\n\n3:01:31.980 --> 3:01:34.500\n If I offered you tea, you should really be worried.\n\n3:01:34.500 --> 3:01:35.500\n Yeah.\n\n3:01:35.500 --> 3:01:36.500\n Why?\n\n3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:41.740\n I mean, that's the, no, that's the, like the more famous way that Russians usually assassinate\n\n3:01:41.740 --> 3:01:42.740\n it.\n\n3:01:42.740 --> 3:01:43.740\n They put poison in the tea.\n\n3:01:43.740 --> 3:01:49.420\n Cause a lot of Russians drink tea and you know, all right, well, I mean there is a blade\n\n3:01:49.420 --> 3:01:50.420\n right there.\n\n3:01:50.420 --> 3:01:54.580\n So I thought was somebody, um, Andrew Huberman gave that to me.\n\n3:01:54.580 --> 3:01:55.580\n He's also good.\n\n3:01:55.580 --> 3:01:58.700\n I don't know if you know him, but he's a cool, I don't know all the people, you know, I'm\n\n3:01:58.700 --> 3:01:59.700\n new.\n\n3:01:59.700 --> 3:02:00.700\n Okay.\n\n3:02:00.700 --> 3:02:01.700\n I'm new here, Lex.\n\n3:02:01.700 --> 3:02:02.700\n You're going to have to send instructions.\n\n3:02:02.700 --> 3:02:03.700\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:03.700 --> 3:02:06.540\n I'm going to have to let my friends say, he says, uh, he's an ex operator and he'll message\n\n3:02:06.540 --> 3:02:08.820\n me once in a while and ask me something and I'll answer back.\n\n3:02:08.820 --> 3:02:14.060\n If I answer in the correct way, he'll go candidate meets expectations.\n\n3:02:14.060 --> 3:02:15.340\n I'm like, fuck you.\n\n3:02:15.340 --> 3:02:16.780\n I'm not a candidate of anything.\n\n3:02:16.780 --> 3:02:17.780\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:17.780 --> 3:02:18.780\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:18.780 --> 3:02:19.780\n But yeah, it's essentially.\n\n3:02:19.780 --> 3:02:21.500\n Well, Andrew Huberman is kind of a celebrity.\n\n3:02:21.500 --> 3:02:23.340\n Andrew, you should check her out.\n\n3:02:23.340 --> 3:02:25.140\n Uh, you're, you're an interesting person.\n\n3:02:25.140 --> 3:02:26.140\n You guys should connect.\n\n3:02:26.140 --> 3:02:32.300\n He's a Stanford neuroscientist was a, I think the number one podcast in the world in health.\n\n3:02:32.300 --> 3:02:37.140\n Uh, he's a, does he have like a, a beard thing going?\n\n3:02:37.140 --> 3:02:38.140\n Uh, yeah.\n\n3:02:38.140 --> 3:02:42.500\n I mean, I'm knocking him down to like, does he have a beard?\n\n3:02:42.500 --> 3:02:45.300\n I don't, I don't look, I don't look at people's visual appearance, man.\n\n3:02:45.300 --> 3:02:46.300\n No, I don't.\n\n3:02:46.300 --> 3:02:47.580\n Uh, does he have a beard?\n\n3:02:47.580 --> 3:02:48.580\n I think he has a beard.\n\n3:02:48.580 --> 3:02:49.580\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:49.580 --> 3:02:54.020\n He's a very handsome gentleman.\n\n3:02:54.020 --> 3:02:56.540\n I think I know you're talking about, cause I think I was looking at his stuff this morning.\n\n3:02:56.540 --> 3:02:57.540\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n3:02:57.540 --> 3:02:58.540\n No, seriously on Instagram.\n\n3:02:58.540 --> 3:02:59.540\n No, no, no.\n\n3:02:59.540 --> 3:03:00.540\n Okay.\n\n3:03:00.540 --> 3:03:01.540\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:01.540 --> 3:03:02.540\n I know him.\n\n3:03:02.540 --> 3:03:04.260\n But it's very, very humble, very intelligent.\n\n3:03:04.260 --> 3:03:05.260\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:05.260 --> 3:03:09.180\n Probably you would understand, like I'm very kind of poetic and so on.\n\n3:03:09.180 --> 3:03:16.660\n He's, he's probably the most like rigorous, um, reference machine of science.\n\n3:03:16.660 --> 3:03:18.140\n Like he's a legit scientist.\n\n3:03:18.140 --> 3:03:22.100\n Like he knows every paper and everything has to do with the mind and neuroscience.\n\n3:03:22.100 --> 3:03:23.100\n Like performance.\n\n3:03:23.100 --> 3:03:24.100\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:24.100 --> 3:03:25.100\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:25.100 --> 3:03:31.140\n He's much more, he's, he's, he's much more actually, and the focus is always on, um,\n\n3:03:31.140 --> 3:03:34.500\n how to help, how that helps people.\n\n3:03:34.500 --> 3:03:38.420\n So like protocols, like, like here's what you need to do to get better sleep.\n\n3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:39.420\n Yes.\n\n3:03:39.420 --> 3:03:40.420\n Yes, I know who it is.\n\n3:03:40.420 --> 3:03:41.420\n Here's like a thousand papers.\n\n3:03:41.420 --> 3:03:42.420\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:42.420 --> 3:03:44.260\n And he just goes like hammers nonstop.\n\n3:03:44.260 --> 3:03:51.700\n I mean, he, um, he spent a week in Austin, he's coming back and spending, uh, a couple\n\n3:03:51.700 --> 3:03:52.700\n of weeks in Austin.\n\n3:03:52.700 --> 3:03:53.700\n We just hang out.\n\n3:03:53.700 --> 3:03:58.420\n And it's like, you think that was like a teleprompter or something, like the way he does his podcast.\n\n3:03:58.420 --> 3:03:59.420\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:59.420 --> 3:04:05.340\n Like in person, he's the same, like, all right, this is, this is intense, but I like it.\n\n3:04:05.340 --> 3:04:06.340\n Anyway.\n\n3:04:06.340 --> 3:04:07.340\n Anyway.\n\n3:04:07.340 --> 3:04:08.820\n Uh, why did we bring him up?\n\n3:04:08.820 --> 3:04:09.820\n I don't know.\n\n3:04:09.820 --> 3:04:10.820\n Brought up knives.\n\n3:04:10.820 --> 3:04:11.820\n We were talking about.\n\n3:04:11.820 --> 3:04:12.820\n He gave it to me.\n\n3:04:12.820 --> 3:04:13.820\n That's right.\n\n3:04:13.820 --> 3:04:14.820\n PTSD.\n\n3:04:14.820 --> 3:04:15.820\n Yeah.\n\n3:04:15.820 --> 3:04:16.820\n And then you talk about poison and how you were poisoning me.\n\n3:04:16.820 --> 3:04:17.820\n And I said, knives.\n\n3:04:17.820 --> 3:04:18.820\n We're talking about Russians.\n\n3:04:18.820 --> 3:04:21.260\n And then we were kind of talking about the brain and PTSD.\n\n3:04:21.260 --> 3:04:22.260\n Yeah.\n\n3:04:22.260 --> 3:04:27.900\n I think for, for most people though, the biggest thing when they see somebody who's struggling\n\n3:04:27.900 --> 3:04:32.020\n with PTSD there, their first, you know, reaction is how do I help them?\n\n3:04:32.020 --> 3:04:36.860\n Well, often just saying, Hey, I'm here when you're ready to talk and you're going through\n\n3:04:36.860 --> 3:04:39.740\n something, whether you want to talk about it right now or not, I'm here.\n\n3:04:39.740 --> 3:04:42.620\n And then keeping a close eye on behaviors.\n\n3:04:42.620 --> 3:04:49.420\n When you start to see somebody having, you know, four, five, six beers at night, let's\n\n3:04:49.420 --> 3:04:50.420\n ask why.\n\n3:04:50.420 --> 3:04:52.460\n When you see somebody, you can tell they're not sleeping.\n\n3:04:52.460 --> 3:04:53.460\n Hey buddy, you sleeping?\n\n3:04:53.460 --> 3:04:54.460\n I just am not sleeping.\n\n3:04:54.460 --> 3:04:58.260\n Instead of just going, Oh, that sucks.\n\n3:04:58.260 --> 3:05:00.340\n Hey, why aren't you sleeping?\n\n3:05:00.340 --> 3:05:01.340\n You having nightmares?\n\n3:05:01.340 --> 3:05:03.860\n Are you, you just have an insomnia?\n\n3:05:03.860 --> 3:05:05.700\n Are you just eating sugar before bed?\n\n3:05:05.700 --> 3:05:10.700\n Like care enough about your people to just ask one followup question.\n\n3:05:10.700 --> 3:05:12.780\n Cause often that's really all it takes.\n\n3:05:12.780 --> 3:05:18.060\n Cause then somebody goes, somebody cares enough to ask and then they'll just, yeah.\n\n3:05:18.060 --> 3:05:20.060\n Just showing that you care.\n\n3:05:20.060 --> 3:05:22.540\n Honestly, grocery store lineup.\n\n3:05:22.540 --> 3:05:24.580\n I'll say, Oh, I like your dress.\n\n3:05:24.580 --> 3:05:25.580\n Oh, thank you.\n\n3:05:25.580 --> 3:05:27.060\n And then I'll go, how's your day going?\n\n3:05:27.060 --> 3:05:30.380\n They're like, actually it's going all right.\n\n3:05:30.380 --> 3:05:33.100\n It's not as great as I thought it would be today, but I'm doing okay.\n\n3:05:33.100 --> 3:05:36.660\n But like they'll give you a, instead of good you, instead of just giving you this fake,\n\n3:05:36.660 --> 3:05:37.660\n false reaction.\n\n3:05:37.660 --> 3:05:44.100\n If you just show any effort in somebody that you care at all about someone's wellbeing,\n\n3:05:44.100 --> 3:05:45.100\n you'd be amazed.\n\n3:05:45.100 --> 3:05:46.100\n Amazed.\n\n3:05:46.100 --> 3:05:49.100\n And some of that is just energy.\n\n3:05:49.100 --> 3:05:54.980\n The reason honestly I moved to Austin is some lady at a Walmart said, honey, you look handsome\n\n3:05:54.980 --> 3:05:55.980\n in that suit.\n\n3:05:55.980 --> 3:06:01.700\n But the care that she put in that, she just looked at me and it wasn't like hitting at\n\n3:06:01.700 --> 3:06:02.700\n me or something.\n\n3:06:02.700 --> 3:06:03.700\n She was like, the love.\n\n3:06:03.700 --> 3:06:04.700\n Just love.\n\n3:06:04.700 --> 3:06:05.700\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:05.700 --> 3:06:06.700\n And I was like, Oh, okay.\n\n3:06:06.700 --> 3:06:07.700\n I'm moving here.\n\n3:06:07.700 --> 3:06:08.700\n I guess.\n\n3:06:08.700 --> 3:06:09.700\n There was a, that's so funny you said that.\n\n3:06:09.700 --> 3:06:13.720\n Cause I told my, I told my husband this happened and it was, it threw me off.\n\n3:06:13.720 --> 3:06:18.700\n There was an older lady at a store and this was right after we, we got a brief period\n\n3:06:18.700 --> 3:06:20.500\n of no masks in Canada.\n\n3:06:20.500 --> 3:06:21.500\n Just like a brief.\n\n3:06:21.500 --> 3:06:22.500\n It's like five minutes.\n\n3:06:22.500 --> 3:06:23.500\n Oh yeah.\n\n3:06:23.500 --> 3:06:24.500\n It was not even that.\n\n3:06:24.500 --> 3:06:26.760\n And I, I had come from like an interview or something.\n\n3:06:26.760 --> 3:06:30.140\n So I had actually had makeup on that day and I had my hat and I was, you know, just at\n\n3:06:30.140 --> 3:06:31.200\n the grocery store.\n\n3:06:31.200 --> 3:06:34.260\n She walked up to me and she got real close and I didn't know what was happening.\n\n3:06:34.260 --> 3:06:37.880\n And then she got closer and then she just grabbed my arm like this.\n\n3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:40.600\n She goes, I love that hat on you.\n\n3:06:40.600 --> 3:06:43.860\n And I looked at her and I was like, she touched me during a pandemic and she's old.\n\n3:06:43.860 --> 3:06:45.180\n Oh my God, I love you too.\n\n3:06:45.180 --> 3:06:46.180\n Thank you so much.\n\n3:06:46.180 --> 3:06:47.180\n I said, you're so amazing.\n\n3:06:47.180 --> 3:06:49.100\n And I just, and I just sparked a conversation.\n\n3:06:49.100 --> 3:06:50.100\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:50.100 --> 3:06:51.100\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:51.100 --> 3:06:52.100\n That's amazing.\n\n3:06:52.100 --> 3:06:53.100\n Doesn't take much.\n\n3:06:53.100 --> 3:06:54.100\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:54.100 --> 3:06:55.100\n That little moment of genuine care.\n\n3:06:55.100 --> 3:07:01.780\n Maybe you can tell me actually the, um, the journey you took with ayahuasca, like what\n\n3:07:01.780 --> 3:07:03.040\n that's such a fascinating journey.\n\n3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:08.740\n So like, uh, letting your mind go to different places in order to rediscover itself, like,\n\n3:07:08.740 --> 3:07:13.580\n like, what is it like a rocket ship to somewhere else so you can land in a better place?\n\n3:07:13.580 --> 3:07:16.740\n Here, how about I show you something that'll help your brain.\n\n3:07:16.740 --> 3:07:17.740\n Yes.\n\n3:07:17.740 --> 3:07:21.100\n This is not for you to lift up either and show on the camera because there's leaves\n\n3:07:21.100 --> 3:07:22.100\n in it.\n\n3:07:22.100 --> 3:07:23.100\n Like there's leaves in some pages.\n\n3:07:23.100 --> 3:07:25.980\n So just don't dump it out cause it'll go all fucking everywhere.\n\n3:07:25.980 --> 3:07:26.980\n Got it.\n\n3:07:26.980 --> 3:07:27.980\n Got it.\n\n3:07:27.980 --> 3:07:28.980\n Instructions.\n\n3:07:28.980 --> 3:07:29.980\n I like this.\n\n3:07:29.980 --> 3:07:30.980\n Yeah.\n\n3:07:30.980 --> 3:07:31.980\n Well, you feel like you need them.\n\n3:07:31.980 --> 3:07:39.500\n Um, ayahuasca is a beautiful psychedelic that we have been so blessed to have on this earth\n\n3:07:39.500 --> 3:07:45.740\n that we have so underutilized and could be, I don't want to say saving humanity, but just\n\n3:07:45.740 --> 3:07:48.700\n you ever hear that saying, if you could just give everyone mushrooms one time, the world\n\n3:07:48.700 --> 3:07:50.300\n would be a better place.\n\n3:07:50.300 --> 3:07:51.300\n Okay.\n\n3:07:51.300 --> 3:07:57.580\n So psilocybin is I use for microdosing, uh, for depression.\n\n3:07:57.580 --> 3:08:00.580\n I did ayahuasca in January of this year.\n\n3:08:00.580 --> 3:08:06.380\n Um, and I've at that point, that was the last time I was on a pharmaceutical drug.\n\n3:08:06.380 --> 3:08:09.940\n I've been off everything ever since 10 different ones.\n\n3:08:09.940 --> 3:08:14.540\n So if you backtrack a little bit, just to, so you'll understand my doctor gave me the\n\n3:08:14.540 --> 3:08:17.740\n opportunity, Dr. Greg Passi.\n\n3:08:17.740 --> 3:08:20.980\n He is a veteran himself, served in Bosnia and Rwanda.\n\n3:08:20.980 --> 3:08:21.980\n He's a medic.\n\n3:08:21.980 --> 3:08:22.980\n He's a Colonel.\n\n3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:25.280\n I think Colonel Lieutenant, he's going to fucking punch me right in the face for that.\n\n3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:26.780\n He's high up officer.\n\n3:08:26.780 --> 3:08:29.380\n Um, he is one of my saviors.\n\n3:08:29.380 --> 3:08:31.220\n He's like my old, I call him my old man.\n\n3:08:31.220 --> 3:08:35.340\n He's my favorite and, um, rides a Harley, like that kind of guy.\n\n3:08:35.340 --> 3:08:36.340\n Nice.\n\n3:08:36.340 --> 3:08:37.340\n Yeah.\n\n3:08:37.340 --> 3:08:41.300\n And, um, he said, you know, Kels, this is, I just don't, I was hitting a wall.\n\n3:08:41.300 --> 3:08:42.300\n I wasn't getting any better.\n\n3:08:42.300 --> 3:08:45.140\n And he goes, what, how do you feel about cannabis?\n\n3:08:45.140 --> 3:08:51.380\n And I was like, I don't feel good about it because family histories or my parents always\n\n3:08:51.380 --> 3:08:55.580\n told me if I smoked weed, you know, it's just this, this perception because I just want\n\n3:08:55.580 --> 3:08:56.700\n you to try it.\n\n3:08:56.700 --> 3:08:58.420\n Just would it, would you be willing to try it?\n\n3:08:58.420 --> 3:09:01.580\n So I was like, okay, so I was willing to try it.\n\n3:09:01.580 --> 3:09:06.420\n Then I started going to these groups called Women Grow and, um, learning about it.\n\n3:09:06.420 --> 3:09:12.620\n And then I realized, oh, I'm starting to sleep a little bit.\n\n3:09:12.620 --> 3:09:14.780\n I don't feel groggy in the morning.\n\n3:09:14.780 --> 3:09:16.620\n I don't feel like a bag of shit.\n\n3:09:16.620 --> 3:09:21.060\n And I also want to have a baby one day and I can't have all this stuff in my system.\n\n3:09:21.060 --> 3:09:27.700\n So I started using cannabis and then I started using it as a main medication and I'd been\n\n3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:38.980\n using it now since 2014, got married, 2015, 2015, 2015 I started using it.\n\n3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:41.060\n And then I've been using it ever since.\n\n3:09:41.060 --> 3:09:46.460\n And that was the way I got off of all the pharmaceutical drugs was keeping cannabis\n\n3:09:46.460 --> 3:09:51.700\n the constant, finding the right strains for me, and then slowly with the doctor's advice\n\n3:09:51.700 --> 3:09:56.380\n and under supervision going off of those medications.\n\n3:09:56.380 --> 3:10:01.900\n Back to January of 2021, I had hit a really bad spell last year.\n\n3:10:01.900 --> 3:10:04.660\n Um, and the year before it was a really big struggle.\n\n3:10:04.660 --> 3:10:09.380\n Uh, I almost lost my company last year due to COVID just like many, many millions of\n\n3:10:09.380 --> 3:10:10.860\n people did.\n\n3:10:10.860 --> 3:10:17.740\n Um, and instead of me just laying down and taking it, I pivoted really quickly and called\n\n3:10:17.740 --> 3:10:19.380\n the factory and said, do you guys make masks?\n\n3:10:19.380 --> 3:10:21.100\n They're like, yeah, we're making masks.\n\n3:10:21.100 --> 3:10:23.980\n I was like, I'm going to call the Canadian government.\n\n3:10:23.980 --> 3:10:27.620\n I'm going to get my medical license and I'm going to try to sell the masks and see if\n\n3:10:27.620 --> 3:10:28.620\n we can do that.\n\n3:10:28.620 --> 3:10:29.620\n And so we did that.\n\n3:10:29.620 --> 3:10:37.860\n And so we did 200,000 masks for Ontario hospitals, um, which ironically went to my entire community\n\n3:10:37.860 --> 3:10:39.860\n I was born and raised in.\n\n3:10:39.860 --> 3:10:41.740\n So it was really weird.\n\n3:10:41.740 --> 3:10:43.740\n And that kept us afloat long enough.\n\n3:10:43.740 --> 3:10:49.260\n Um, we lost 200 retail locations that I all single handedly spent five years going like\n\n3:10:49.260 --> 3:10:50.740\n door to door getting myself.\n\n3:10:50.740 --> 3:10:51.740\n Um,\n\n3:10:51.740 --> 3:10:54.940\n and we should say this is brass and unity, jewelry,\n\n3:10:54.940 --> 3:10:57.220\n the jewelry and sunglass company.\n\n3:10:57.220 --> 3:10:58.220\n And um, I started,\n\n3:10:58.220 --> 3:10:59.220\n speaking of which,\n\n3:10:59.220 --> 3:11:02.220\n looks like a cereal.\n\n3:11:02.220 --> 3:11:05.020\n I mean, you do look good in them.\n\n3:11:05.020 --> 3:11:06.020\n I won't lie to you.\n\n3:11:06.020 --> 3:11:07.020\n Thank you.\n\n3:11:07.020 --> 3:11:08.020\n Well, okay.\n\n3:11:08.020 --> 3:11:09.020\n We'll call them the Lex.\n\n3:11:09.020 --> 3:11:10.020\n That's those are now called the Lex.\n\n3:11:10.020 --> 3:11:11.020\n Fuck the gunner.\n\n3:11:11.020 --> 3:11:12.020\n They're the Lex.\n\n3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:13.020\n I like it.\n\n3:11:13.020 --> 3:11:14.020\n The Lex.\n\n3:11:14.020 --> 3:11:15.020\n I'm jumping around here, but just bear with me.\n\n3:11:15.020 --> 3:11:16.020\n I, I started, my doctor suggested art therapy.\n\n3:11:16.020 --> 3:11:17.220\n Dr. Patsy did.\n\n3:11:17.220 --> 3:11:19.140\n And that's really how the company started.\n\n3:11:19.140 --> 3:11:23.140\n I bought beads and a pipe cutter and a hammer and a drill and I fucked up our kitchen table\n\n3:11:23.140 --> 3:11:26.860\n and I taught myself how to put jewelry cause my husband was like, you can do it.\n\n3:11:26.860 --> 3:11:27.860\n Go for it.\n\n3:11:27.860 --> 3:11:31.020\n So I was like, okay, he says I can believes in me, so I guess I can do it.\n\n3:11:31.020 --> 3:11:32.980\n No idea what I'm doing.\n\n3:11:32.980 --> 3:11:38.060\n And then got to this point, um, you know, where COVID hit and people lost companies\n\n3:11:38.060 --> 3:11:40.900\n and we pivoted and we did what we could.\n\n3:11:40.900 --> 3:11:45.420\n And then I really started to go downhill psychologically.\n\n3:11:45.420 --> 3:11:49.020\n I've found purpose again with this company.\n\n3:11:49.020 --> 3:11:51.260\n I found a way to help again.\n\n3:11:51.260 --> 3:11:54.700\n I found myself again.\n\n3:11:54.700 --> 3:11:58.560\n And then that was in danger of being gone again.\n\n3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:01.140\n So the company is 2015.\n\n3:12:01.140 --> 3:12:06.300\n We started, I started building jewelry in 2015 under like a just, it was called her\n\n3:12:06.300 --> 3:12:11.500\n wearables and it was really small and it was just, I was just trying to make stuff.\n\n3:12:11.500 --> 3:12:13.220\n It wasn't supposed to be a company.\n\n3:12:13.220 --> 3:12:17.940\n And you were on a ton of medication throughout this whole process.\n\n3:12:17.940 --> 3:12:23.540\n And my mom being the tenacious truck driver she is, she was driving for Kevin Hart's what\n\n3:12:23.540 --> 3:12:25.140\n now tour.\n\n3:12:25.140 --> 3:12:29.540\n And so she got, she just harassed them was like, you need to meet my daughter.\n\n3:12:29.540 --> 3:12:30.540\n Yeah.\n\n3:12:30.540 --> 3:12:32.540\n I saw the picture of you and Kevin Hart, that's cool.\n\n3:12:32.540 --> 3:12:33.940\n But he just gave me a good piece of advice.\n\n3:12:33.940 --> 3:12:36.980\n Hey, if you're going to make this something, you can't really, if you want it to be for\n\n3:12:36.980 --> 3:12:38.460\n everyone, you can't call it her wearables.\n\n3:12:38.460 --> 3:12:39.900\n I was like, cool.\n\n3:12:39.900 --> 3:12:44.220\n And then we drove home that night and then he tweeted it out to people to 24 million\n\n3:12:44.220 --> 3:12:45.220\n people.\n\n3:12:45.220 --> 3:12:47.980\n And he was like, who is now?\n\n3:12:47.980 --> 3:12:49.620\n And that was a giant deal.\n\n3:12:49.620 --> 3:12:52.500\n And then my husband kind of looked at me and being, he's so fucking brilliant.\n\n3:12:52.500 --> 3:12:55.040\n He looked at me and goes, all right, yeah, we got to come up with a rename.\n\n3:12:55.040 --> 3:12:56.040\n Let me start thinking.\n\n3:12:56.040 --> 3:12:57.040\n Let me start brainstorming.\n\n3:12:57.040 --> 3:12:58.340\n Like, let's make, you want to make this real?\n\n3:12:58.340 --> 3:12:59.340\n Let's make this real.\n\n3:12:59.340 --> 3:13:01.200\n And so we did.\n\n3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:04.580\n And he was like, what do you think about like, we were doing like brass collective co, brass\n\n3:13:04.580 --> 3:13:07.420\n this, but I just knew I wanted brass in the name.\n\n3:13:07.420 --> 3:13:08.560\n And then he's like, what about brass and unity?\n\n3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:09.780\n You're trying to like unify people.\n\n3:13:09.780 --> 3:13:10.780\n Like why wouldn't you do that?\n\n3:13:10.780 --> 3:13:13.460\n I'm like, fucking million horses came up with it.\n\n3:13:13.460 --> 3:13:14.460\n Like everything else.\n\n3:13:14.460 --> 3:13:15.460\n That's a great name.\n\n3:13:15.460 --> 3:13:16.460\n Well, he's a brilliant person.\n\n3:13:16.460 --> 3:13:17.460\n It's annoying.\n\n3:13:17.460 --> 3:13:18.460\n Yeah.\n\n3:13:18.460 --> 3:13:22.220\n So the idea of losing this thing that we had just built and just got me kind of functioning\n\n3:13:22.220 --> 3:13:24.860\n with was devastating.\n\n3:13:24.860 --> 3:13:29.780\n So I got this opportunity given to me by Griff, Combat Flip Flops.\n\n3:13:29.780 --> 3:13:34.340\n Um, again, Brady, my husband was like, Hey, you should get sponsors for your podcast.\n\n3:13:34.340 --> 3:13:37.020\n Hey, have you heard of this company, Combat Flip Flops?\n\n3:13:37.020 --> 3:13:38.900\n Remember we watched them on Shark Tank.\n\n3:13:38.900 --> 3:13:40.980\n And then I reached out, he emailed me back.\n\n3:13:40.980 --> 3:13:43.860\n He's like, yeah, we go to together like peanut butter and jelly are companies.\n\n3:13:43.860 --> 3:13:45.460\n That sounds great.\n\n3:13:45.460 --> 3:13:49.700\n And then I was like, Hey, also, like, do you think one of your owners would want to come\n\n3:13:49.700 --> 3:13:50.820\n on the podcast?\n\n3:13:50.820 --> 3:13:54.340\n Just like tossing it out there kind of like I did with you.\n\n3:13:54.340 --> 3:13:56.420\n And he was like, yeah, I'd love to come on.\n\n3:13:56.420 --> 3:13:59.060\n And I was like, oh my God.\n\n3:13:59.060 --> 3:14:01.140\n And he came on the podcast and it went great.\n\n3:14:01.140 --> 3:14:04.620\n And then at the end of it, we stopped recording and he just kind of did this thing.\n\n3:14:04.620 --> 3:14:05.620\n He does this.\n\n3:14:05.620 --> 3:14:11.020\n Just like leans in real close, looks into your soul and goes, how you doing?\n\n3:14:11.020 --> 3:14:12.020\n And they're like, great.\n\n3:14:12.020 --> 3:14:14.020\n And he's like, how you really doing?\n\n3:14:14.020 --> 3:14:16.020\n And I'm like, I'm horrible.\n\n3:14:16.020 --> 3:14:18.020\n I've done everything.\n\n3:14:18.020 --> 3:14:22.980\n And just this whole, just like waterworks happen and he goes, listen, have you ever\n\n3:14:22.980 --> 3:14:23.980\n heard of Ayahuasca?\n\n3:14:23.980 --> 3:14:29.260\n And I was like, yeah, like in movies and like psychedelics in the seventies, you know, and\n\n3:14:29.260 --> 3:14:30.500\n he's like, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n3:14:30.500 --> 3:14:31.500\n Let's like have a talk.\n\n3:14:31.500 --> 3:14:34.020\n And he goes, I've got an opportunity for a spot.\n\n3:14:34.020 --> 3:14:37.140\n I'm going with this charity called Heroic Hearts.\n\n3:14:37.140 --> 3:14:41.700\n They have spaces in UK, Canada and the United States.\n\n3:14:41.700 --> 3:14:44.100\n They're owned by an army ranger named Jesse Gould.\n\n3:14:44.100 --> 3:14:47.900\n You know, they're really trying to help vets.\n\n3:14:47.900 --> 3:14:48.900\n And this has worked.\n\n3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:49.900\n Would you want to come?\n\n3:14:49.900 --> 3:14:53.780\n And before he even said, like, would you, before I even got like an invite, I was like,\n\n3:14:53.780 --> 3:14:54.780\n can I come?\n\n3:14:54.780 --> 3:14:57.900\n When can I, when, when, when do we, when do we go?\n\n3:14:57.900 --> 3:14:59.940\n And he's like, oh, it's in like three weeks.\n\n3:14:59.940 --> 3:15:02.460\n You can't be on any SSRIs.\n\n3:15:02.460 --> 3:15:04.060\n If you're on any, you're going to have to wean off.\n\n3:15:04.060 --> 3:15:06.620\n And at the time I was on my last one.\n\n3:15:06.620 --> 3:15:10.340\n And so I was like, I called my doctor and I was like, listen.\n\n3:15:10.340 --> 3:15:11.820\n And he was like, what?\n\n3:15:11.820 --> 3:15:13.700\n And I was like, guess what I'm about to do?\n\n3:15:13.700 --> 3:15:16.340\n And he's like, I'm like going to go do ayahuasca.\n\n3:15:16.340 --> 3:15:23.420\n And he goes, you're going to, he does this thing where he just goes, all right.\n\n3:15:23.420 --> 3:15:24.900\n Because he knows he's not going to win.\n\n3:15:24.900 --> 3:15:26.300\n He knows I'll just fight him on it.\n\n3:15:26.300 --> 3:15:30.900\n That's just called that, like the, the Jocko reset because he does a.\n\n3:15:30.900 --> 3:15:31.900\n Pretty much.\n\n3:15:31.900 --> 3:15:32.900\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n3:15:32.900 --> 3:15:35.260\n And he goes, I said, but here's the kicker.\n\n3:15:35.260 --> 3:15:36.620\n I have to go off of this medication.\n\n3:15:36.620 --> 3:15:40.580\n And he goes, well, you know, we're supposed to do that in the summer months when the depression's\n\n3:15:40.580 --> 3:15:42.580\n not like bringing, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n3:15:42.580 --> 3:15:46.020\n Listen, I hear you, but I'm doing it.\n\n3:15:46.020 --> 3:15:47.020\n Whether you want me to or not.\n\n3:15:47.020 --> 3:15:50.020\n So I'm letting you know, Hey, this is going to happen.\n\n3:15:50.020 --> 3:15:51.860\n And he's like, okay, just try to do it properly.\n\n3:15:51.860 --> 3:15:52.860\n I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n3:15:52.860 --> 3:15:53.860\n I know the drill.\n\n3:15:53.860 --> 3:15:54.860\n I know the drill, whatever, whatever.\n\n3:15:54.860 --> 3:15:55.860\n I went to school to be a paramedic.\n\n3:15:55.860 --> 3:15:56.860\n I know the drill.\n\n3:15:56.860 --> 3:15:57.860\n I'll go off of it properly.\n\n3:15:57.860 --> 3:16:02.180\n So I can like drop that within a week that stuff was, I was done taking it.\n\n3:16:02.180 --> 3:16:06.260\n And I was going through like the world's worst just withdrawals.\n\n3:16:06.260 --> 3:16:10.860\n It was like you were at a rock concert and your head was banging up and down, but you\n\n3:16:10.860 --> 3:16:13.180\n were sitting perfectly still.\n\n3:16:13.180 --> 3:16:14.180\n It was horrible.\n\n3:16:14.180 --> 3:16:17.740\n But you had like a thing to look forward to with the sidewall.\n\n3:16:17.740 --> 3:16:22.940\n I had a light at the end of the tunnel and I knew if I got to the light was the worst\n\n3:16:22.940 --> 3:16:23.940\n that's going to happen.\n\n3:16:23.940 --> 3:16:24.940\n Just get to the light.\n\n3:16:24.940 --> 3:16:29.500\n But at that point, like I, again, I had a son, I had a husband, I had a great company,\n\n3:16:29.500 --> 3:16:33.460\n I have a great house, I have a nice car, I have everything.\n\n3:16:33.460 --> 3:16:36.780\n Why did I want to die every minute of the day?\n\n3:16:36.780 --> 3:16:38.820\n I was at that point again.\n\n3:16:38.820 --> 3:16:41.340\n And I'm like, this has got it, something's got to give.\n\n3:16:41.340 --> 3:17:02.580\n And so I went and I got there and she is the most intense, beautiful, divine deity or entity\n\n3:17:02.580 --> 3:17:11.620\n or visualization, whatever you want to deem ayahuasca as, mama ayahuasca is real.\n\n3:17:11.620 --> 3:17:15.060\n And she takes no prisoners.\n\n3:17:15.060 --> 3:17:23.500\n She shows you exactly what you need to see to help yourself, but she does not discriminate\n\n3:17:23.500 --> 3:17:26.340\n against whether you're ready or not.\n\n3:17:26.340 --> 3:17:30.640\n If you've ingested it, she's coming for you.\n\n3:17:30.640 --> 3:17:34.600\n She's going to be either gentle or she's going to beat your ass.\n\n3:17:34.600 --> 3:17:43.220\n And sometimes that's what you need, but she does it in a way that is profound.\n\n3:17:43.220 --> 3:17:46.940\n So what were some memorable, profound moments for you?\n\n3:17:46.940 --> 3:17:52.180\n What what are the places it took you, these people had you meet?\n\n3:17:52.180 --> 3:17:58.180\n For the first time, I got to be in a group of people who didn't judge me or question\n\n3:17:58.180 --> 3:17:59.360\n my service.\n\n3:17:59.360 --> 3:18:01.420\n They just respect me.\n\n3:18:01.420 --> 3:18:03.060\n That was number one.\n\n3:18:03.060 --> 3:18:09.240\n So that group I lost, I just found again.\n\n3:18:09.240 --> 3:18:12.420\n Big shocker, I was the only woman there again.\n\n3:18:12.420 --> 3:18:16.020\n Seems to be the thing for me.\n\n3:18:16.020 --> 3:18:18.660\n And so I was surrounded by all these special operators.\n\n3:18:18.660 --> 3:18:20.020\n These aren't like normal soldiers.\n\n3:18:20.020 --> 3:18:28.220\n These guys that I'm with are like, Bronze Star, fucking Purple Heart, just the coolest\n\n3:18:28.220 --> 3:18:29.820\n people.\n\n3:18:29.820 --> 3:18:32.200\n People I've always wanted to be like, that's my buddy.\n\n3:18:32.200 --> 3:18:36.640\n Now I can be like, those are my buddies, like those motherfuckers will go to bat for me.\n\n3:18:36.640 --> 3:18:38.140\n They will bend over backwards.\n\n3:18:38.140 --> 3:18:40.060\n They will exfil me out of anywhere.\n\n3:18:40.060 --> 3:18:42.700\n They will take a bullet for me.\n\n3:18:42.700 --> 3:18:45.880\n And these guys welcomed me in in a way I didn't I didn't expect.\n\n3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:48.160\n So that hit me weird right off the get.\n\n3:18:48.160 --> 3:18:49.160\n I was nervous.\n\n3:18:49.160 --> 3:18:52.160\n And now I was just felt that home for a minute.\n\n3:18:52.160 --> 3:18:59.600\n And then when I stepped into ceremony, the first night because you do you do three nights\n\n3:18:59.600 --> 3:19:06.560\n over like over like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the first night, I was so nervous and so anxious\n\n3:19:06.560 --> 3:19:12.020\n because you go up in ceremony and you're the shamans come in and they cleanse themselves\n\n3:19:12.020 --> 3:19:18.300\n and then you get served the ayah individually, you go up, they give it to you, you can take\n\n3:19:18.300 --> 3:19:21.420\n your time and pray, you can do whatever you want, then you drink it.\n\n3:19:21.420 --> 3:19:29.160\n I was so just like, I got back to my mat and I sat there and I was like trying to keep\n\n3:19:29.160 --> 3:19:30.160\n it in.\n\n3:19:30.160 --> 3:19:34.000\n But I could feel that like heat come from my toes all the way up and you're like your\n\n3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:35.000\n mouth starts to water.\n\n3:19:35.000 --> 3:19:37.200\n I'm gonna throw up, I'm gonna throw up, I'm gonna throw up.\n\n3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:45.560\n And I looked over to Griff and I looked at Bishop and I was like, okay, and you can't\n\n3:19:45.560 --> 3:19:47.600\n talk or anything.\n\n3:19:47.600 --> 3:19:52.220\n So I like my buddy, we call him the Viking, a soul Viking.\n\n3:19:52.220 --> 3:19:57.400\n He looks like a Viking, his head's tattooed, he's been on the show.\n\n3:19:57.400 --> 3:19:58.800\n He's so cool.\n\n3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:01.760\n He's sitting directly across like you and I and he can see me, he's looking at me and\n\n3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:08.720\n I'm throwing up and I do it about three times and then the last time he just saw me and\n\n3:20:08.720 --> 3:20:12.120\n I couldn't do it, I threw it up.\n\n3:20:12.120 --> 3:20:17.900\n And so I like to think that was her way of easing me in so I didn't get like a full punch\n\n3:20:17.900 --> 3:20:18.900\n to the face.\n\n3:20:18.900 --> 3:20:22.480\n But I gotta, let me take your hand and show you what I'm gonna show you.\n\n3:20:22.480 --> 3:20:25.120\n We're gonna make you better, we're gonna take the pain away.\n\n3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:27.760\n Aren't you supposed to eventually throw up no matter what?\n\n3:20:27.760 --> 3:20:29.600\n It's not supposed to, some people don't.\n\n3:20:29.600 --> 3:20:30.600\n You purge.\n\n3:20:30.600 --> 3:20:33.560\n Yeah, if something's happening, you're going through something, yeah, you purge.\n\n3:20:33.560 --> 3:20:34.840\n But it doesn't have to happen.\n\n3:20:34.840 --> 3:20:37.960\n But this, I mean, within like the first 20 minutes, no.\n\n3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:42.400\n It just takes like, you gotta sit and meditate for, or sit still basically and meditate\n\n3:20:42.400 --> 3:20:48.260\n in the pitch black for about 45 minutes before the effects even, before you even feel her.\n\n3:20:48.260 --> 3:20:50.080\n So it's very.\n\n3:20:50.080 --> 3:20:52.960\n So here she figured out the right dose you need, maybe.\n\n3:20:52.960 --> 3:20:55.000\n Well because I did the same dose as everyone else.\n\n3:20:55.000 --> 3:21:01.760\n I think it was 20 mils, which doesn't seem like a lot, but when you've never done hiatus.\n\n3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:03.760\n Oh my god.\n\n3:21:03.760 --> 3:21:06.960\n So I felt like such a bitch.\n\n3:21:06.960 --> 3:21:09.040\n God, I felt like such a bitch.\n\n3:21:09.040 --> 3:21:11.440\n Okay, that was the thought going through your mind.\n\n3:21:11.440 --> 3:21:13.160\n Oh, you just fucked it all up.\n\n3:21:13.160 --> 3:21:14.160\n You ruined it.\n\n3:21:14.160 --> 3:21:15.160\n You ruined this again.\n\n3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:16.640\n You couldn't do this right?\n\n3:21:16.640 --> 3:21:17.640\n Yeah.\n\n3:21:17.640 --> 3:21:24.280\n And so at that point, we went through the meditation part and the shamans were, they\n\n3:21:24.280 --> 3:21:26.600\n literally sing for like six hours straight.\n\n3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:31.400\n So you sit there, you take it and then there's just what you're quietly listening to them.\n\n3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:35.840\n Meditate and you wait and you wait and you're in pitch black, like can't see this far in\n\n3:21:35.840 --> 3:21:37.560\n front of your face.\n\n3:21:37.560 --> 3:21:41.680\n And you have a little puke bucket and then you have a little light that has a red filter\n\n3:21:41.680 --> 3:21:42.680\n on it.\n\n3:21:42.680 --> 3:21:44.920\n You have to get up to go to the bathroom to get out of the yurt and you use that so you\n\n3:21:44.920 --> 3:21:47.320\n don't turn lights on.\n\n3:21:47.320 --> 3:21:49.680\n And me, I brought like what?\n\n3:21:49.680 --> 3:21:55.200\n No, it's just a cool visual of just a puke bucket and a little light for the, like I\n\n3:21:55.200 --> 3:21:58.400\n can imagine these like little lights going every once in a while and then the rest is\n\n3:21:58.400 --> 3:22:03.560\n just in darkness meditating with this singing.\n\n3:22:03.560 --> 3:22:04.560\n It's so beautiful.\n\n3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:05.560\n It's cool.\n\n3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:06.560\n I would love to do that sometime.\n\n3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:12.120\n Because trust me, you would, I wouldn't offer if it wasn't the group I would trust.\n\n3:22:12.120 --> 3:22:14.520\n Yeah that's in, you had a very interesting group.\n\n3:22:14.520 --> 3:22:16.760\n So it's the Heroic Hearts people.\n\n3:22:16.760 --> 3:22:17.760\n Yeah, Heroic Hearts.\n\n3:22:17.760 --> 3:22:20.560\n So they, yeah, this is my, Jesse gave us all these journals.\n\n3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:22.380\n They're like, you're going to want these.\n\n3:22:22.380 --> 3:22:26.960\n So he gave us all these journals and now this is like my Bible, like my work, my everything\n\n3:22:26.960 --> 3:22:28.840\n goes in this with me everywhere.\n\n3:22:28.840 --> 3:22:31.440\n It's just this like silent reminder for me.\n\n3:22:31.440 --> 3:22:34.960\n And so Heroic Hearts does fantastic work.\n\n3:22:34.960 --> 3:22:37.120\n I'll get into them after.\n\n3:22:37.120 --> 3:22:44.400\n The thing with this group is there's such care.\n\n3:22:44.400 --> 3:22:46.680\n It's not like go do AYA and like you're done.\n\n3:22:46.680 --> 3:22:50.240\n There's like integration coaches and there's like doctors and there's like people to make\n\n3:22:50.240 --> 3:22:55.360\n sure that you're doing the work because AYA is just the, is just the gate.\n\n3:22:55.360 --> 3:22:59.800\n Now you have to take it and you have to implement it into your life.\n\n3:22:59.800 --> 3:23:00.800\n People don't do that though.\n\n3:23:00.800 --> 3:23:02.360\n Did you do like integration?\n\n3:23:02.360 --> 3:23:04.480\n Did you do conversations with somebody?\n\n3:23:04.480 --> 3:23:11.960\n Did you talk to, like, is there a process to, because similar with psilocybin you mentioned,\n\n3:23:11.960 --> 3:23:16.720\n as I understand, it's exceptionally beneficial for when you also do like talk therapy.\n\n3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:21.520\n Like you couple that with the integration in some form where you talk through your experience\n\n3:23:21.520 --> 3:23:23.320\n and you talk through different things.\n\n3:23:23.320 --> 3:23:27.960\n Like that seems to be a really, you know, I need to do that more with basically every\n\n3:23:27.960 --> 3:23:28.960\n substance I take.\n\n3:23:28.960 --> 3:23:33.240\n Like if I get, which I have been every once in a while known to do, a bit of vodka or\n\n3:23:33.240 --> 3:23:37.800\n whiskey or whatever, like do integration the next day.\n\n3:23:37.800 --> 3:23:38.800\n What did you learn?\n\n3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:39.800\n What did you get from that?\n\n3:23:39.800 --> 3:23:40.800\n What did you get?\n\n3:23:40.800 --> 3:23:43.400\n Because you learn a lot, but you sometimes kind of just move on and you celebrate that\n\n3:23:43.400 --> 3:23:46.240\n that happened, but like really kind of think through it.\n\n3:23:46.240 --> 3:23:47.240\n Write it down.\n\n3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:48.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:50.080\n It's important because that's what this was.\n\n3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:55.200\n So the first night, I'll give like a very, because trust me, we could spend a whole podcast\n\n3:23:55.200 --> 3:23:58.920\n on both of the, all three of those nights, but the first night, the biggest thing that\n\n3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:04.000\n happened for me is I got to see my daughter, which was my first baby.\n\n3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:07.360\n And so people say, well, you know, blah, blah, blah.\n\n3:24:07.360 --> 3:24:08.360\n Fuck you.\n\n3:24:08.360 --> 3:24:09.360\n That was my daughter.\n\n3:24:09.360 --> 3:24:12.880\n And I'm very aware it was, I'm very conscious that it was.\n\n3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:19.360\n And at that point, she just eased me in enough to let me know and showed me enough that this\n\n3:24:19.360 --> 3:24:20.600\n wasn't it.\n\n3:24:20.600 --> 3:24:23.680\n This wasn't the end all be all.\n\n3:24:23.680 --> 3:24:28.760\n Where you are right now on this plane, on this dimension, in this life, this is, this\n\n3:24:28.760 --> 3:24:34.720\n is a blip and it is, it is so minuscule to the big picture.\n\n3:24:34.720 --> 3:24:40.280\n And so she really did that by, she showed me just a black and then like a crack.\n\n3:24:40.280 --> 3:24:44.360\n And then these vibrant colors that I can't describe because there aren't words, Alex\n\n3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:48.040\n Gray does really great art.\n\n3:24:48.040 --> 3:24:51.480\n And that is like been the closest thing I've been able to find colors.\n\n3:24:51.480 --> 3:24:56.720\n He's a famous guy who does ayahuasca and he's an artist.\n\n3:24:56.720 --> 3:24:59.240\n I think he's got stuff in New York as well.\n\n3:24:59.240 --> 3:25:07.600\n But she just, she eased me in and gave me some relief and showed me enough that I could\n\n3:25:07.600 --> 3:25:12.960\n go, I could wake up the next day and not want to die the next day.\n\n3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:16.360\n And so what Heroic Heart said, because they gave us all these journals, they're like,\n\n3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:23.520\n you know, the next day you kind of wake up and you, you do a meet, like a meeting.\n\n3:25:23.520 --> 3:25:24.520\n You do like a circle.\n\n3:25:24.520 --> 3:25:27.960\n You just sit in a room and talk about what just happened the night before.\n\n3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:32.680\n People are crying and people are quiet and you just listen and that's what you do.\n\n3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:35.080\n And then you write on your free time.\n\n3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:37.320\n So after that, it's like up to you what you want to do.\n\n3:25:37.320 --> 3:25:38.840\n Do you want to just go walk in the woods?\n\n3:25:38.840 --> 3:25:43.400\n Well, I chose to go find a fence post and lie on it for an hour.\n\n3:25:43.400 --> 3:25:44.400\n I'm not kidding.\n\n3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:48.120\n I lied there and stared up at these two eagles that were just in like the, I'll tell you\n\n3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:50.960\n where we were after and you'll be like, oh, okay, I get it.\n\n3:25:50.960 --> 3:25:59.400\n And then I found a forest and I just walked up with my book and I just lied there for\n\n3:25:59.400 --> 3:26:01.920\n hours.\n\n3:26:01.920 --> 3:26:05.320\n And then she all of a sudden started giving me what you call your downloads.\n\n3:26:05.320 --> 3:26:09.240\n So the stuff you learn, the stuff that you were all of a sudden you're remembering and\n\n3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:11.040\n these messages that come through.\n\n3:26:11.040 --> 3:26:13.360\n And that's what this is.\n\n3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:17.580\n What kind of things are we talking about?\n\n3:26:17.580 --> 3:26:21.920\n So my biggest thing that she tried to reiterate to me at the beginning of that first night\n\n3:26:21.920 --> 3:26:24.760\n was that I don't breathe.\n\n3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:30.920\n I just, I don't, I don't breathe.\n\n3:26:30.920 --> 3:26:32.840\n I don't fucking breathe at all.\n\n3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:35.600\n I just, one thing to the next thing, the next thing, the next thing, the next thing just\n\n3:26:35.600 --> 3:26:36.600\n to survive.\n\n3:26:36.600 --> 3:26:39.120\n I don't take a minute and breathe.\n\n3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:43.220\n And so she made, when I say she and I say it because it's hard for people to understand,\n\n3:26:43.220 --> 3:26:47.120\n but I showed this to my husband, I showed it to my doctors and they're like, bitch, that's\n\n3:26:47.120 --> 3:26:48.120\n not you.\n\n3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:49.120\n You don't write like that.\n\n3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:50.120\n You don't talk like that.\n\n3:26:50.120 --> 3:26:57.560\n So like you can flip through it, but it was like, I'll just give, I'll just let Lex read\n\n3:26:57.560 --> 3:26:59.240\n for a second and just, I'll just do here.\n\n3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:01.160\n Let me do, I'll do an ad for heroic hearts.\n\n3:27:01.160 --> 3:27:02.160\n Heroic hearts.\n\n3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:04.800\n Here, I'll get my papers while you read.\n\n3:27:04.800 --> 3:27:07.240\n Connect to her, listen to her, open to her.\n\n3:27:07.240 --> 3:27:08.360\n Do you mind if I read some of these?\n\n3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:09.360\n You can read some of it.\n\n3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:10.360\n Yep.\n\n3:27:10.360 --> 3:27:11.360\n Go right ahead.\n\n3:27:11.360 --> 3:27:13.360\n The dark has lifted.\n\n3:27:13.360 --> 3:27:16.760\n Judge my spelling and I'll punch you right in the face.\n\n3:27:16.760 --> 3:27:22.640\n So there's like, it's very sporadic, sporadically written.\n\n3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:24.240\n It's okay to be still.\n\n3:27:24.240 --> 3:27:26.040\n It's okay to be quiet.\n\n3:27:26.040 --> 3:27:28.480\n This is good.\n\n3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:34.320\n Like what, and these are over a stretch of, that was the first, the first couple of pages\n\n3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:36.480\n were from the first night.\n\n3:27:36.480 --> 3:27:37.480\n This was just that weekend.\n\n3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:40.600\n And you're just there laying looking at the Eagles.\n\n3:27:40.600 --> 3:27:41.600\n Yeah.\n\n3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:46.000\n With a pen, just frantic as well, Lex, not like writing where you're like, Oh, I'm just\n\n3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:47.000\n writing.\n\n3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:52.120\n It's like, I had to get it down or I was going to lose it.\n\n3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:54.520\n You are warrior.\n\n3:27:54.520 --> 3:27:56.360\n You are power.\n\n3:27:56.360 --> 3:28:11.400\n You can choose now, breathe now, be now, be present, be warrior, be strength, breathe,\n\n3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:12.400\n be the strength.\n\n3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:15.000\n You are the strength.\n\n3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:17.000\n There's some soul searching going on here.\n\n3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:18.000\n This is incredible.\n\n3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:19.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:20.000\n We wait till you get through.\n\n3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:21.000\n You get in there.\n\n3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:25.560\n She gets deep, real aggressive, like.\n\n3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:33.920\n Crack the door for I am the light, the giver, the taker.\n\n3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:34.920\n I am warrior.\n\n3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:35.920\n I am life.\n\n3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:36.920\n I am air.\n\n3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:37.920\n I am water.\n\n3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:39.400\n I am fire.\n\n3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:44.320\n I am light.\n\n3:28:44.320 --> 3:28:46.400\n This will, this can.\n\n3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:49.760\n This will, this can.\n\n3:28:49.760 --> 3:28:53.840\n For I am warrior.\n\n3:28:53.840 --> 3:28:54.840\n For I am light.\n\n3:28:54.840 --> 3:28:56.360\n And there's a leaf here.\n\n3:28:56.360 --> 3:28:57.880\n What's the story with the leaf?\n\n3:28:57.880 --> 3:28:58.880\n I don't know.\n\n3:28:58.880 --> 3:29:02.160\n I was walking and every single time over the, over those three days, anytime I like went\n\n3:29:02.160 --> 3:29:09.760\n for a walk by myself, I would just hear like, take this, like just almost like as if a voice\n\n3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:12.440\n was standing there and be like, you need this, take it, take it with you and keep it in your\n\n3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:13.440\n book.\n\n3:29:13.440 --> 3:29:16.600\n Ground you.\n\n3:29:16.600 --> 3:29:17.600\n And it just goes off.\n\n3:29:17.600 --> 3:29:18.600\n So this is from there.\n\n3:29:18.600 --> 3:29:19.600\n Yeah.\n\n3:29:19.600 --> 3:29:23.160\n It's cool to have sort of, it's almost like time travel.\n\n3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:28.400\n I have poppies from France too when I did a, I did a 75th anniversary D Day ride in France\n\n3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:32.120\n where we rode 600 kilometers on our road bikes for charity.\n\n3:29:32.120 --> 3:29:37.960\n And we landed on the beaches of Juneau on the 75th and we got to go by the poppy fields\n\n3:29:37.960 --> 3:29:42.760\n and I'm like covered in poppies and I have some in a book.\n\n3:29:42.760 --> 3:29:44.120\n I don't know why I do that.\n\n3:29:44.120 --> 3:29:47.160\n I just, I do that.\n\n3:29:47.160 --> 3:29:51.680\n That's cool because like, these are your thoughts and those are the physical items as it really\n\n3:29:51.680 --> 3:29:55.200\n helps transport to that place somehow.\n\n3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:56.680\n Let the light in, let her in.\n\n3:29:56.680 --> 3:30:02.840\n And she would show me these visuals.\n\n3:30:02.840 --> 3:30:12.120\n So my drawings are just like, yeah, there's drawings here and you're seeing this stuff.\n\n3:30:12.120 --> 3:30:14.720\n Oh yeah.\n\n3:30:14.720 --> 3:30:15.720\n I can't draw either.\n\n3:30:15.720 --> 3:30:20.280\n So that's why they're so, I wish I could draw because if only I could translate what I could\n\n3:30:20.280 --> 3:30:24.560\n see visually onto paper.\n\n3:30:24.560 --> 3:30:26.320\n And you're talking to her.\n\n3:30:26.320 --> 3:30:27.320\n Yeah.\n\n3:30:27.320 --> 3:30:28.320\n It's time.\n\n3:30:28.320 --> 3:30:32.000\n I'm here to listen.\n\n3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:34.040\n Is this Mama Aya?\n\n3:30:34.040 --> 3:30:35.040\n Yeah.\n\n3:30:35.040 --> 3:30:36.040\n We call her Mama Aya.\n\n3:30:36.040 --> 3:30:37.040\n Mama Aya.\n\n3:30:37.040 --> 3:30:38.040\n Mama Aya.\n\n3:30:38.040 --> 3:30:41.080\n So what, who, who are you seeing?\n\n3:30:41.080 --> 3:30:42.380\n Is this a woman?\n\n3:30:42.380 --> 3:30:46.160\n So for me at first, it was just eyes floating in the sky.\n\n3:30:46.160 --> 3:30:50.920\n These unbelievably gorgeous, beautiful eyes that I, and I was like literally looking up\n\n3:30:50.920 --> 3:30:55.040\n at the top of the yurt and I kept going to myself, is anyone else seeing this?\n\n3:30:55.040 --> 3:30:59.160\n There's eyes in the sky.\n\n3:30:59.160 --> 3:31:04.020\n And so there's these eyes floating and they just kept looking at me.\n\n3:31:04.020 --> 3:31:07.080\n And I remember when I kept telling myself like, oh, don't worry about it, there's nothing\n\n3:31:07.080 --> 3:31:08.080\n there.\n\n3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:09.520\n She would get angry.\n\n3:31:09.520 --> 3:31:11.480\n I'm right here.\n\n3:31:11.480 --> 3:31:12.480\n Pay attention to me.\n\n3:31:12.480 --> 3:31:17.640\n And I'd be like, okay, like forceful, like very forceful.\n\n3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:20.520\n So at first it was just the eyes.\n\n3:31:20.520 --> 3:31:32.200\n The second night, is I'm crazy when I say this, great, that's going to be my clip, easy\n\n3:31:32.200 --> 3:31:33.200\n on crazy.\n\n3:31:33.200 --> 3:31:35.760\n It's what I do when I get uncomfortable.\n\n3:31:35.760 --> 3:31:37.960\n I do weird hand gestures and movements.\n\n3:31:37.960 --> 3:31:40.080\n Voices, I like it.\n\n3:31:40.080 --> 3:31:41.080\n Yeah, I do.\n\n3:31:41.080 --> 3:31:42.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:48.120\n You would hate to be in my office because most of the day it's just this weird lunges\n\n3:31:48.120 --> 3:31:50.440\n and uncomfortable moments.\n\n3:31:50.440 --> 3:31:54.960\n She turned me into a wolf.\n\n3:31:54.960 --> 3:31:55.960\n I know I said it out loud.\n\n3:31:55.960 --> 3:32:01.380\n I said, I hear it, I said it, head to toe.\n\n3:32:01.380 --> 3:32:07.600\n And her takeaway for me was, I'm trying to be this pack leader, I'm trying to be this\n\n3:32:07.600 --> 3:32:08.600\n leader in my life.\n\n3:32:08.600 --> 3:32:13.820\n I'm trying to do these things, but I'm going about them the whole wrong way.\n\n3:32:13.820 --> 3:32:18.080\n So like when the shamans call you up to do their special prayer over you, you go up,\n\n3:32:18.080 --> 3:32:19.080\n you don't touch them.\n\n3:32:19.080 --> 3:32:20.080\n They flash their little light.\n\n3:32:20.080 --> 3:32:24.080\n You see the little light spot, you walk to the light, you sit down on the light.\n\n3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:27.480\n And then my shaman, he's so funny because he's got this great tone in his voice.\n\n3:32:27.480 --> 3:32:31.440\n He goes, how are you doing Kelsey?\n\n3:32:31.440 --> 3:32:37.240\n And I'm like, so hi, yeah, I have a problem.\n\n3:32:37.240 --> 3:32:39.560\n I'm a wolf and I need it to stop.\n\n3:32:39.560 --> 3:32:42.600\n And he'd be like, don't you worry girl, I got you, you ready?\n\n3:32:42.600 --> 3:32:44.600\n And I was like, uh huh, uh huh.\n\n3:32:44.600 --> 3:32:48.400\n So I'm sitting there cross legged, I've got my palms out like this.\n\n3:32:48.400 --> 3:32:50.240\n And I had a really traumatic shoulder injury.\n\n3:32:50.240 --> 3:32:51.860\n So I don't just sit slanted like this.\n\n3:32:51.860 --> 3:32:55.240\n My shoulders actually permanently detached and no one in the world will touch it or fix\n\n3:32:55.240 --> 3:32:56.240\n it.\n\n3:32:56.240 --> 3:33:00.960\n My collarbone comes out my back here and I don't have any collarbone here.\n\n3:33:00.960 --> 3:33:02.520\n So nobody will fix it.\n\n3:33:02.520 --> 3:33:03.880\n No one will touch it.\n\n3:33:03.880 --> 3:33:06.840\n Even I've had specialists, I've had surgeries, no one will do anything with it.\n\n3:33:06.840 --> 3:33:09.640\n So I'm permanently down and forward.\n\n3:33:09.640 --> 3:33:14.920\n So I slouch, it's horrible.\n\n3:33:14.920 --> 3:33:15.920\n So before I.\n\n3:33:15.920 --> 3:33:16.920\n Functionally too.\n\n3:33:16.920 --> 3:33:17.920\n Oh, there's nothing.\n\n3:33:17.920 --> 3:33:18.920\n I can't do a pull up anymore.\n\n3:33:18.920 --> 3:33:19.920\n Oh, so weak.\n\n3:33:19.920 --> 3:33:20.920\n Oh, wow.\n\n3:33:20.920 --> 3:33:26.480\n Oh, you should, I'll show you how to do a pushup after you'll fucking throw up in embarrassment.\n\n3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:27.700\n Yeah, it's bad.\n\n3:33:27.700 --> 3:33:32.120\n So before I though, chronic pain, like had to drink a bottle of CBD every day just to\n\n3:33:32.120 --> 3:33:38.040\n the pain is so bad because the trauma and it was so bad, the surgery went wrong.\n\n3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:40.740\n The collarbone dissipated and no longer exists.\n\n3:33:40.740 --> 3:33:44.920\n Like there's just, and they're not sure how I lift things with it and do stuff with it.\n\n3:33:44.920 --> 3:33:46.920\n It's like overcompensation everywhere.\n\n3:33:46.920 --> 3:33:53.080\n Like my, the, my back, like, um, my trap, my scapula, like flares outward.\n\n3:33:53.080 --> 3:33:54.880\n It's I'm all messed up from it.\n\n3:33:54.880 --> 3:33:56.480\n And so I was in chronic pain.\n\n3:33:56.480 --> 3:34:03.720\n So he's praying over me and all of a sudden all I feel is this arm just start just fucking\n\n3:34:03.720 --> 3:34:08.440\n vibrating and my hair's really long and I feel somebody grabbed the back of my ponytail\n\n3:34:08.440 --> 3:34:12.140\n and snap my head back like this.\n\n3:34:12.140 --> 3:34:18.920\n And it felt like something was coming out of my throat, like being pulled out of me\n\n3:34:18.920 --> 3:34:22.200\n in the takeaway that I ended up in the whole, the rest of the night, there was a million\n\n3:34:22.200 --> 3:34:23.200\n other things.\n\n3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:30.160\n And the takeaway was you no longer need to bite.\n\n3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:32.560\n You may only show your teeth.\n\n3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:35.320\n You can be the leader that you want to be.\n\n3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:39.460\n You do not always have to be the traditional type of leader.\n\n3:34:39.460 --> 3:34:41.120\n You can be in the back of the pack.\n\n3:34:41.120 --> 3:34:46.920\n You have to watch the rest around you be, be mindful of those around you instead of\n\n3:34:46.920 --> 3:34:50.620\n just being upfront, be, be behind as well.\n\n3:34:50.620 --> 3:34:54.680\n Make sure that every thing that you're doing is all being looked after.\n\n3:34:54.680 --> 3:34:58.120\n Because my thing was I will rip your fucking head off if you just say the wrong thing to\n\n3:34:58.120 --> 3:34:59.760\n me before.\n\n3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:03.880\n The whole thing was you can just show your teeth and that is more than enough.\n\n3:35:03.880 --> 3:35:07.160\n Stop trying to be, stop trying to overcompensate.\n\n3:35:07.160 --> 3:35:09.400\n You don't need to do that any longer.\n\n3:35:09.400 --> 3:35:15.920\n And then I had this weird astral projection thing happen like where I was in my house\n\n3:35:15.920 --> 3:35:22.520\n and there were these flyers all over my husband and my son and like I went ham on them.\n\n3:35:22.520 --> 3:35:24.640\n I like shredded them to pieces.\n\n3:35:24.640 --> 3:35:28.120\n Like I was this protector.\n\n3:35:28.120 --> 3:35:33.280\n And it's crazy because the guys told me after like someone would be like, there were flyers\n\n3:35:33.280 --> 3:35:35.120\n all over you the whole night.\n\n3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:36.200\n They were just all over you.\n\n3:35:36.200 --> 3:35:38.800\n And I'm like, I was snarling when I was sitting there.\n\n3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:43.920\n Like the shaman had to be like, I need you to try to calm your breathing after I could.\n\n3:35:43.920 --> 3:35:50.200\n But before like I was like attacking things beside me that people could see and I could\n\n3:35:50.200 --> 3:35:53.400\n see but couldn't wrap my brain around that they were real.\n\n3:35:53.400 --> 3:35:54.400\n Like it was weird.\n\n3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:58.440\n This is a crazy man.\n\n3:35:58.440 --> 3:35:59.440\n That's day two.\n\n3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:00.440\n That's day two.\n\n3:36:00.440 --> 3:36:03.760\n And so what's the big takeaway there?\n\n3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:11.480\n My takeaway was I needed to be, I needed to stop trying to, stop trying to push everything\n\n3:36:11.480 --> 3:36:12.480\n too hard.\n\n3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:14.560\n Stop trying to force everything.\n\n3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:15.680\n It's all going to come.\n\n3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:17.080\n It's all going to happen.\n\n3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:20.160\n But you are, you are too aggressive.\n\n3:36:20.160 --> 3:36:26.240\n You are too, you're trying so hard that you're missing, you're missing everything else.\n\n3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:27.240\n Got it.\n\n3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:31.480\n That's just how to be a better human kind of thing.\n\n3:36:31.480 --> 3:36:32.800\n Right.\n\n3:36:32.800 --> 3:36:33.800\n This is getting intense.\n\n3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:34.800\n Yeah, it gets aggressive.\n\n3:36:34.800 --> 3:36:35.800\n Yeah, it gets aggressive.\n\n3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:42.520\n I mean there's love and light still.\n\n3:36:42.520 --> 3:36:43.520\n It gets better.\n\n3:36:43.520 --> 3:36:44.520\n Love and light.\n\n3:36:44.520 --> 3:36:48.680\n Love and light the warrior within is calm.\n\n3:36:48.680 --> 3:36:50.520\n She will test you daily.\n\n3:36:50.520 --> 3:36:52.160\n Show her respect.\n\n3:36:52.160 --> 3:36:53.160\n So that's what I mean.\n\n3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:54.160\n You've read my book.\n\n3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:55.160\n You know I don't write like that.\n\n3:36:55.160 --> 3:36:56.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:36:56.160 --> 3:36:57.160\n This is strange.\n\n3:36:57.160 --> 3:36:58.160\n See?\n\n3:36:58.160 --> 3:36:59.160\n Good.\n\n3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:00.160\n You get it.\n\n3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:04.640\n Because people don't understand when I say I didn't, I don't feel like I wrote that.\n\n3:37:04.640 --> 3:37:10.280\n I feel like she gave me, like I reread this all of the time.\n\n3:37:10.280 --> 3:37:16.160\n So I wonder, I mean, well not obviously, but this is somehow part of you.\n\n3:37:16.160 --> 3:37:18.840\n I think it's a part of me obviously.\n\n3:37:18.840 --> 3:37:20.480\n Reconnecting you somehow to that part.\n\n3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:24.840\n It kind of is incredible to think of what are the things that are part of us that we\n\n3:37:24.840 --> 3:37:26.880\n haven't really explored, you know.\n\n3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:28.920\n And there's so many.\n\n3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:29.920\n We just get to talk.\n\n3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:30.920\n Nature.\n\n3:37:30.920 --> 3:37:31.920\n To connect to her.\n\n3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:34.520\n Feel her flow through them.\n\n3:37:34.520 --> 3:37:39.360\n Use them for the strength for each day a new challenge will present itself.\n\n3:37:39.360 --> 3:37:40.360\n Love.\n\n3:37:40.360 --> 3:37:41.360\n Light.\n\n3:37:41.360 --> 3:37:42.360\n Breathe.\n\n3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:45.120\n Sorry I have too much hair.\n\n3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:46.120\n Never enough.\n\n3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:47.120\n I used to have long hair.\n\n3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:48.480\n What about day three?\n\n3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:52.640\n So day three is the, the stuff I talked about on Jocko.\n\n3:37:52.640 --> 3:37:55.080\n When I got taken over to the other side.\n\n3:37:55.080 --> 3:37:57.240\n I almost missed that night too.\n\n3:37:57.240 --> 3:37:59.160\n I almost missed that ceremony.\n\n3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:04.920\n I got a false positive on my COVID test and I got a call from the medical clinic that\n\n3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:07.920\n night being like, you need to come in.\n\n3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:10.240\n You got a false positive on your COVID test.\n\n3:38:10.240 --> 3:38:14.120\n And if you're going to travel, you have to, we got to figure this out.\n\n3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:15.120\n You got to come do blood work.\n\n3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:19.320\n You got to come do, you know, whatever it is you need to do if you want to get home,\n\n3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:21.280\n but you got to come do something.\n\n3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:24.920\n And so I didn't think I was going to be in ceremony.\n\n3:38:24.920 --> 3:38:25.920\n I had to leave.\n\n3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:35.660\n So I left and you know, they waited, they waited for me.\n\n3:38:35.660 --> 3:38:43.500\n And so I think the biggest takeaway from all of this for me was this isn't it.\n\n3:38:43.500 --> 3:38:45.280\n This isn't everything.\n\n3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:49.500\n This isn't the end all be all.\n\n3:38:49.500 --> 3:38:50.960\n You can fight through this.\n\n3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:52.480\n This is possible.\n\n3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:53.520\n It's going to take work.\n\n3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:55.540\n It's going to be fucking hard.\n\n3:38:55.540 --> 3:38:56.540\n It's worth it though.\n\n3:38:56.540 --> 3:39:01.640\n And if you just keep going in the right direction, everything that I wrote down, everything,\n\n3:39:01.640 --> 3:39:05.000\n every goal, it'll happen.\n\n3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.040\n What about love?\n\n3:39:07.040 --> 3:39:09.540\n What about love?\n\n3:39:09.540 --> 3:39:10.540\n Tell me about your husband.\n\n3:39:10.540 --> 3:39:11.540\n Okay.\n\n3:39:11.540 --> 3:39:12.760\n He's the best.\n\n3:39:12.760 --> 3:39:15.960\n What role did he play in your life?\n\n3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:17.440\n The most pivotal role.\n\n3:39:17.440 --> 3:39:22.920\n He kept me alive and made me feel worthy enough to, until I knew that I was worthy enough\n\n3:39:22.920 --> 3:39:25.160\n to be alive.\n\n3:39:25.160 --> 3:39:26.440\n Can you dissect that a little bit?\n\n3:39:26.440 --> 3:39:31.040\n Like what, I mean, what role does love play in the human condition?\n\n3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:36.120\n I think love is the only reason that we haven't destroyed ourselves.\n\n3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:39.080\n I mean, we humans in general.\n\n3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:40.080\n Yes.\n\n3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:46.480\n I think there is a subset of people where love will always be, you know, love conquers\n\n3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:49.720\n all, you know, but that's not always the reality.\n\n3:39:49.720 --> 3:39:56.040\n The reality is life is messy and humans are messy and the way we choose to deal with things\n\n3:39:56.040 --> 3:40:02.780\n are messy and complicated and difficult, but at the root of all good is love, I think.\n\n3:40:02.780 --> 3:40:11.240\n And for me, I was fortunate enough to meet my husband through a friend, which you listened\n\n3:40:11.240 --> 3:40:12.240\n to that podcast.\n\n3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:16.520\n So I don't know that we need to, unless you really want to go into that story again, how\n\n3:40:16.520 --> 3:40:18.000\n I met my husband.\n\n3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:21.920\n Well, the only part of that story I like, people should just go listen to the Jackal\n\n3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:23.840\n podcast is how you made him uncomfortable.\n\n3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:24.840\n I love it.\n\n3:40:24.840 --> 3:40:25.840\n I, well, okay.\n\n3:40:25.840 --> 3:40:26.840\n So how it works, let me explain.\n\n3:40:26.840 --> 3:40:29.440\n In the supercross and motocross industry, it's really small.\n\n3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:32.180\n The people who are professional, there's, it's a small subset of people.\n\n3:40:32.180 --> 3:40:35.020\n It's kind of like formula one, 21 cars.\n\n3:40:35.020 --> 3:40:36.020\n That's what there is.\n\n3:40:36.020 --> 3:40:37.020\n That's the amount of riders.\n\n3:40:37.020 --> 3:40:40.240\n And we should say your husband is a motocross guy.\n\n3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:44.680\n My husband was a professional supercross and motocross racer for his whole life.\n\n3:40:44.680 --> 3:40:48.560\n And he raced for Kawasaki and Suzuki.\n\n3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:51.280\n He lived in California and raced all down there.\n\n3:40:51.280 --> 3:40:54.280\n And when I met him, I met him at the tail end of his career.\n\n3:40:54.280 --> 3:41:00.860\n And so I went to Montreal with a friend of mine to see somebody that I was currently\n\n3:41:00.860 --> 3:41:08.480\n sleeping with, who was a friend of mine and end up meeting Brady instead.\n\n3:41:08.480 --> 3:41:09.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:13.440\n And the funny moment in Jackal's podcast was saying that I was fucking him instead\n\n3:41:13.440 --> 3:41:14.920\n of just sleeping with him.\n\n3:41:14.920 --> 3:41:18.680\n And then Jackal's face exploded and Jackal was like, oh, sleeping.\n\n3:41:18.680 --> 3:41:23.100\n So like he was, he was trying to get details of the sleeping quarters that you're just\n\n3:41:23.100 --> 3:41:26.800\n trying to get you to define as a good interviewer would, oh, sleeping, okay.\n\n3:41:26.800 --> 3:41:32.080\n And then you were like, it's fucking Jackal or something like that.\n\n3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:33.080\n It was great.\n\n3:41:33.080 --> 3:41:34.080\n It was great.\n\n3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:37.500\n But that's true because in that industry, it's like, we, it's small.\n\n3:41:37.500 --> 3:41:41.600\n We all share, trust me, is what it is.\n\n3:41:41.600 --> 3:41:45.240\n And it was, so I met him there and he had broken his wrist really, really bad.\n\n3:41:45.240 --> 3:41:48.680\n And I was, this was before I deployed.\n\n3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:54.220\n So I met him and I, we stayed in touch and just became friends and just texted.\n\n3:41:54.220 --> 3:41:55.220\n That was it.\n\n3:41:55.220 --> 3:41:56.220\n Nothing weird.\n\n3:41:56.220 --> 3:41:57.640\n And I was deploying though.\n\n3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:00.160\n So we just agreed, you know, we'd be friends.\n\n3:42:00.160 --> 3:42:04.080\n We weren't actually talking about anything romantically at all.\n\n3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:09.360\n And then I deployed and we got talking and to know each other a little more, a little\n\n3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:10.640\n more.\n\n3:42:10.640 --> 3:42:14.160\n And then we decided that we liked each other and we wanted to try to give it at least a\n\n3:42:14.160 --> 3:42:15.440\n semi shot.\n\n3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:21.720\n And so when I got home from Afghanistan, I went and watched him race his last, one of\n\n3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:27.280\n his last two races that he did professionally before he retired, excuse me.\n\n3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:34.080\n And it was in Montreal and one was in Vegas and I hadn't seen him and he didn't really\n\n3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:35.080\n know me.\n\n3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:36.440\n We didn't really know each other.\n\n3:42:36.440 --> 3:42:41.040\n We met, I slept in the bed beside him because my girlfriend didn't want to get in trouble\n\n3:42:41.040 --> 3:42:45.080\n from her boyfriend from sleeping beside a random dude.\n\n3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:54.080\n And then, yeah, we just, we started dating and he really slowly became my rock and he\n\n3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:55.520\n understands trauma.\n\n3:42:55.520 --> 3:43:00.640\n He had some stuff happen in his life and his family that he went through a lot of therapy.\n\n3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:01.640\n He went through a lot of shit.\n\n3:43:01.640 --> 3:43:07.200\n He went, he saw what traumatic situations can do to a family and to people and those\n\n3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:09.420\n that are suffering with it.\n\n3:43:09.420 --> 3:43:15.420\n And so he was well equipped to handle me, thankfully.\n\n3:43:15.420 --> 3:43:18.320\n And it got to a point where we were doing the long distance back and forth, back and\n\n3:43:18.320 --> 3:43:19.320\n forth and back and forth.\n\n3:43:19.320 --> 3:43:23.240\n And I finally got the call that I was going to be released from the military and I wanted\n\n3:43:23.240 --> 3:43:26.640\n to live near him, but I couldn't afford to live in British Columbia because I was from\n\n3:43:26.640 --> 3:43:31.160\n Ontario and BC is like, it means bring cash for a reason.\n\n3:43:31.160 --> 3:43:32.440\n I'm like, there's no way I can live there.\n\n3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:35.280\n And then his family was like, come live with us.\n\n3:43:35.280 --> 3:43:37.400\n They had a big enough house.\n\n3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:39.040\n They had a big enough house.\n\n3:43:39.040 --> 3:43:40.520\n Trust me, it was fine.\n\n3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:42.440\n So I was like, okay.\n\n3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:49.000\n And so I went from dating this guy long distance to over from 2009 to 2011, just back and forth,\n\n3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:50.880\n back and forth, back and forth.\n\n3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:53.600\n And then finally his parents were like, should her get off the pot here with her?\n\n3:43:53.600 --> 3:43:54.600\n Come on.\n\n3:43:54.600 --> 3:43:58.280\n It's obvious she loves you and I would never say it.\n\n3:43:58.280 --> 3:44:00.320\n That word just as a love.\n\n3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:07.720\n Like it was just, I couldn't say for a long time, for a long time because I was dead inside.\n\n3:44:07.720 --> 3:44:11.700\n I didn't know what that meant because I couldn't feel, I didn't feel anything.\n\n3:44:11.700 --> 3:44:15.120\n He loved it because he like, we go, we go do something.\n\n3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:17.440\n You would never complain about anything.\n\n3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:19.760\n You wouldn't say a fucking word.\n\n3:44:19.760 --> 3:44:20.960\n You would just sit there.\n\n3:44:20.960 --> 3:44:26.000\n And now you got all your feelings back and your emotions back and now you're too hot\n\n3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:27.000\n and you're too cold.\n\n3:44:27.000 --> 3:44:29.520\n And anyways, so yeah, he loved it.\n\n3:44:29.520 --> 3:44:30.880\n I was numb and dead inside.\n\n3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:32.280\n Seriously, when I call him back.\n\n3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:34.160\n Were you still able to have fun together?\n\n3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:35.160\n That kind of thing?\n\n3:44:35.160 --> 3:44:39.680\n Like when you say there's no emotion, there's more emotion around the basics of like everyday\n\n3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:43.880\n life, but you're still able to just like enjoy shit together?\n\n3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:49.000\n I was enjoying stuff, but I wasn't feeling.\n\n3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:50.000\n I was like, this is fun.\n\n3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:51.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:52.000\n Right.\n\n3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:53.000\n That was it.\n\n3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:54.000\n That was surface level like Lex, this is fun.\n\n3:44:54.000 --> 3:44:55.000\n It wasn't.\n\n3:44:55.000 --> 3:44:56.000\n There's nothing there.\n\n3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:02.440\n Yeah, no, there's nothing that, Hey, yeah, nothing.\n\n3:45:02.440 --> 3:45:06.520\n And so we went through that for a long time and then I lived with his parents and we,\n\n3:45:06.520 --> 3:45:09.120\n we lived there and that was, you know, God damn it.\n\n3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:12.280\n His family was so good to me because I was a nightmare.\n\n3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:14.040\n I was a nightmare.\n\n3:45:14.040 --> 3:45:16.080\n Couldn't cook certain food around me anymore.\n\n3:45:16.080 --> 3:45:18.280\n Couldn't, couldn't go certain places anymore.\n\n3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:22.080\n Couldn't, you know, crowds were in hard no, we didn't do Canada today.\n\n3:45:22.080 --> 3:45:26.880\n And like, I just changed, I moved in and was like, shit's got to change.\n\n3:45:26.880 --> 3:45:31.000\n If you guys don't want me to kill everyone, like, and they were willing and they were\n\n3:45:31.000 --> 3:45:34.080\n accepting and they were amazing about it.\n\n3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:37.760\n And then we finally said, okay, well like, does this, is this, we're good.\n\n3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:44.360\n We're like, I said, I used to say like, I L you like, I couldn't say love.\n\n3:45:44.360 --> 3:45:46.680\n It freaked me out for a long time.\n\n3:45:46.680 --> 3:45:50.840\n And then I finally said it and then that shit had said it like a month later and I was like,\n\n3:45:50.840 --> 3:45:51.840\n that's not fair.\n\n3:45:51.840 --> 3:45:52.840\n That's not the same exact time.\n\n3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:53.840\n I wanted the response.\n\n3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:54.840\n Yeah.\n\n3:45:54.840 --> 3:46:00.560\n And he goes to treatment with me, he, whatever I need, he knows that like, hey, it's more\n\n3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:04.040\n for like him and like, how do I handle her?\n\n3:46:04.040 --> 3:46:07.880\n And then we moved out and we bought a house and then he took a sweet ass time.\n\n3:46:07.880 --> 3:46:12.720\n We were dating for four years before we were engaged because just to be sure the crazy\n\n3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:15.520\n wasn't too crazy, he waited four years on that.\n\n3:46:15.520 --> 3:46:16.520\n Smart man.\n\n3:46:16.520 --> 3:46:17.520\n Right?\n\n3:46:17.520 --> 3:46:18.520\n Yeah.\n\n3:46:18.520 --> 3:46:20.800\n Or you can, you could say he's just terrified of commitment, but both.\n\n3:46:20.800 --> 3:46:21.800\n A little bit of both.\n\n3:46:21.800 --> 3:46:26.280\n Hey, when you were the guy on the posters that all the girls sign up to, that sent all\n\n3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:28.680\n the dirty pictures, fucking why are you giving that up?\n\n3:46:28.680 --> 3:46:29.680\n It's easy.\n\n3:46:29.680 --> 3:46:30.680\n Yeah.\n\n3:46:30.680 --> 3:46:31.680\n Commitment is a real commitment then.\n\n3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:32.680\n Yeah.\n\n3:46:32.680 --> 3:46:33.680\n Okay.\n\n3:46:33.680 --> 3:46:37.760\n This is the Jaco reset.\n\n3:46:37.760 --> 3:46:40.400\n We talked about Brass in Unity a little bit.\n\n3:46:40.400 --> 3:46:46.200\n What's the longterm mission goal and dream of your company and the podcast of the same\n\n3:46:46.200 --> 3:46:47.680\n name?\n\n3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:54.600\n So for me, what I've been trying to do with this company is create a community that can\n\n3:46:54.600 --> 3:46:59.620\n really work together to not only help vets, first responders, but to really bridge the\n\n3:46:59.620 --> 3:47:03.760\n gap with the civilian population and letting them know what we kind of go through and why\n\n3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:09.800\n it is such a epidemic and why there is over 22 suicides a day and we are losing people\n\n3:47:09.800 --> 3:47:13.960\n like it's going out of style, like the amount of vets that are questioning the last 20 years\n\n3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:18.760\n of their life right now is terrifying.\n\n3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:22.340\n I work with organizations that are doing this outreach and they're overloaded right now\n\n3:47:22.340 --> 3:47:28.160\n like they have never seen before because this whole thing is just, it's hit ahead here.\n\n3:47:28.160 --> 3:47:33.080\n And so what Brass in Unity tries to do is it is really just a vehicle to get the money\n\n3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:35.520\n in the hands of the people that are doing the work with it.\n\n3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:38.680\n I couldn't start a nonprofit because I'm not good at fundraising.\n\n3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:42.920\n I'm not good at being like, give me your money, I'm going to do this with it.\n\n3:47:42.920 --> 3:47:47.280\n The least I could do is come up with a product that I know I could give to people or people\n\n3:47:47.280 --> 3:47:56.640\n could purchase and if I gave pretty much all of the actual profit from it to those organizations\n\n3:47:56.640 --> 3:48:02.100\n and I give them something to wear that is a touch piece or if they're out and somebody\n\n3:48:02.100 --> 3:48:04.920\n sees a bullet on the wrist they go, hey, what is that?\n\n3:48:04.920 --> 3:48:10.880\n It's a conversation starter and that's exactly what it's been and it's done its job as that.\n\n3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:14.520\n And so we, like I said, we are a way to get the vehicle, we're the vehicle, we're the\n\n3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:15.900\n money in the hands of the people.\n\n3:48:15.900 --> 3:48:18.480\n People don't always want to just get a tax receipt.\n\n3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:22.960\n It's great to donate to something, great on you to do that but most people have a selfish\n\n3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:28.580\n aspect and that's okay but if you can tap into that you can then fund these charities\n\n3:48:28.580 --> 3:48:32.240\n properly and give them the tools to do their jobs effectively.\n\n3:48:32.240 --> 3:48:36.360\n Up until this point they just count on people's goodness of their hearts.\n\n3:48:36.360 --> 3:48:38.900\n Hate to break it to you, humanity is rough right now.\n\n3:48:38.900 --> 3:48:40.960\n We need to look at something a little differently.\n\n3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:46.960\n So these things spark, like a jewelry sparks conversations and then do you work with charities?\n\n3:48:46.960 --> 3:48:49.100\n Yes, oh God, yeah, that's what I do.\n\n3:48:49.100 --> 3:48:54.080\n So my whole mission every day is I get up, I push jewelry and sunglasses on people and\n\n3:48:54.080 --> 3:48:59.480\n say but now that you're gonna wear that, now you're a part of the B&U Army, now you're\n\n3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:00.480\n a part of this community.\n\n3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:05.820\n Speaking of which, let me put it right back on, branded.\n\n3:49:05.820 --> 3:49:07.960\n This is organic product placement.\n\n3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:13.280\n Yeah, this isn't like marketing at all, nothing weird about this at all and so we work with\n\n3:49:13.280 --> 3:49:17.400\n a lot of organizations and I'm very particular about where we send our money because there\n\n3:49:17.400 --> 3:49:24.240\n are, it feels like thousands of vet organizations right now and if we were able to consolidate,\n\n3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:25.240\n it would be more ideal.\n\n3:49:25.240 --> 3:49:28.120\n I spoke about that on another show but that's not currently happening.\n\n3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:32.720\n So I try to work with the nonprofits I know, number one, are not paying six figure salaries\n\n3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:36.180\n which trust me, there's lots, a lot.\n\n3:49:36.180 --> 3:49:39.900\n Number two, I look at the actual resources that they're providing and if they're going\n\n3:49:39.900 --> 3:49:43.400\n to be something that are gonna be useful, in my opinion, whether or not they're actually\n\n3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:46.400\n useful and I just don't think they are, that's up for debate.\n\n3:49:46.400 --> 3:49:50.160\n I know it's worked for me so I try to fund the things that I know have been helpful for\n\n3:49:50.160 --> 3:49:52.720\n me and the people I associate with.\n\n3:49:52.720 --> 3:49:57.900\n So that's why I brought all the paper because I didn't wanna be an idiot and forget anybody\n\n3:49:57.900 --> 3:50:01.160\n that's really important because I get caught up in things and I think it's important to\n\n3:50:01.160 --> 3:50:02.160\n acknowledge.\n\n3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:09.520\n So number one, Heroic Hearts, we just started working to talk about them and really make\n\n3:50:09.520 --> 3:50:12.280\n them known but we're gonna be donating to them as well.\n\n3:50:12.280 --> 3:50:15.040\n Are they doing more stuff than the ayahuasca thing?\n\n3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:19.160\n Yeah, so their points are, I got Jesse to actually, I'm like what are your talking points\n\n3:50:19.160 --> 3:50:21.840\n because I need people to know exactly what you do.\n\n3:50:21.840 --> 3:50:25.120\n So veterans have had to take their mental and general health into their own hands due\n\n3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:29.400\n to the failure of the government system so that is why they were created but Heroic\n\n3:50:29.400 --> 3:50:34.300\n Hearts is a peer supported mental health network involving full preparation, integration, coaching\n\n3:50:34.300 --> 3:50:36.560\n and connection to vetted psychedelic treatments.\n\n3:50:36.560 --> 3:50:42.480\n So they don't just do ayahuasca, they deal with psilocybin, ketamine, ibogaine but they've\n\n3:50:42.480 --> 3:50:47.480\n got protocols in place, they've got locations you go to that are safely vetted and they\n\n3:50:47.480 --> 3:50:48.480\n work.\n\n3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:53.760\n They've got over right now, Jesse said they have 800 veterans on a waiting list for treatment.\n\n3:50:53.760 --> 3:50:57.900\n That's just before the spike of the end of this war.\n\n3:50:57.900 --> 3:51:02.280\n They have over a hundred, they've helped over a hundred veterans including dozens of special\n\n3:51:02.280 --> 3:51:04.960\n operation vets find effective care.\n\n3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:09.360\n They've now got branches in the US, UK and Canada and the biggest thing about them and\n\n3:51:09.360 --> 3:51:14.740\n why we talk about them is because the problem of psychedelics and the stigma around it is\n\n3:51:14.740 --> 3:51:19.080\n so significant but because of great universities that are now stepping up and doing the research\n\n3:51:19.080 --> 3:51:21.360\n behind it, it is being legitimized.\n\n3:51:21.360 --> 3:51:26.400\n So like they're doing that, in Canada there's a group called Theracil, they are currently\n\n3:51:26.400 --> 3:51:31.720\n fighting the government to get the rights for Canadians under section 56 of our laws\n\n3:51:31.720 --> 3:51:34.920\n to get compassionate care for psilocybin use.\n\n3:51:34.920 --> 3:51:40.480\n I've done a panel with them on that really great base out of Victoria, really smart people.\n\n3:51:40.480 --> 3:51:44.200\n One of the other bigger charities that we work with and they're honestly, they were\n\n3:51:44.200 --> 3:51:48.440\n my first and foremost charity that I ever worked with and they're a big component in\n\n3:51:48.440 --> 3:51:51.000\n the veteran community in Canada.\n\n3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:57.680\n They're called Honour House and Honour House was started by honorary Colonel Aldi Genova.\n\n3:51:57.680 --> 3:52:00.120\n It was started because of a guy named Trevor Green.\n\n3:52:00.120 --> 3:52:06.040\n He was a Canadian soldier who deployed and he was, so Captain Trevor Green, sorry Trevor,\n\n3:52:06.040 --> 3:52:11.420\n Captain Trevor Green, he got an ax in the middle of his head, a Taliban member came\n\n3:52:11.420 --> 3:52:16.260\n up and put an ax directly into his head when his helmet was off and he survived.\n\n3:52:16.260 --> 3:52:19.420\n He's done work with Invictus Games and Prince Harry.\n\n3:52:19.420 --> 3:52:22.660\n He has an exoskeleton he uses on the island.\n\n3:52:22.660 --> 3:52:23.660\n He's so cool.\n\n3:52:23.660 --> 3:52:29.280\n He hasn't changed one bit from like the infantry captain you expect him to be.\n\n3:52:29.280 --> 3:52:34.980\n And Al saw there was a need for vets and first responders to get treatment because there's\n\n3:52:34.980 --> 3:52:37.780\n no real home away from home for people.\n\n3:52:37.780 --> 3:52:42.600\n Picture Ronald McDonald for cancer and families, this is vets and first responders.\n\n3:52:42.600 --> 3:52:46.040\n And so their whole thing, and I'll read it so I say it exactly right because I used to\n\n3:52:46.040 --> 3:52:50.100\n be on the board of their charity, but I ran out of time, so now I just consult.\n\n3:52:50.100 --> 3:52:55.420\n But they are a home away from home for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, veterans and\n\n3:52:55.420 --> 3:53:00.440\n first responders and their families to stay completely free of charge while they're receiving\n\n3:53:00.440 --> 3:53:03.640\n medical care and treatment in the Vancouver area.\n\n3:53:03.640 --> 3:53:08.080\n But since then, they've expanded since I've come on board and they've opened Honour Ranch,\n\n3:53:08.080 --> 3:53:14.000\n which is up in Ashcroft, BC and it's 140 acres, 10 cabins and a main cabin.\n\n3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:18.080\n They do equine therapy and they're more focused on operational stress injury clinic.\n\n3:53:18.080 --> 3:53:22.340\n So sorry, operational stress injury within the veteran community.\n\n3:53:22.340 --> 3:53:25.320\n And they have specialists that do that.\n\n3:53:25.320 --> 3:53:27.180\n They have their own bracelet with us.\n\n3:53:27.180 --> 3:53:30.280\n So every time you buy an Honour House bracelet, all the proceeds go to them.\n\n3:53:30.280 --> 3:53:33.760\n And it's actually the green one.\n\n3:53:33.760 --> 3:53:34.760\n So that one.\n\n3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:37.960\n So when you buy one of those Honour House bracelets, they have those.\n\n3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:41.260\n They go directly to them, which is really amazing.\n\n3:53:41.260 --> 3:53:44.600\n They've been near and dear to my heart for a long time.\n\n3:53:44.600 --> 3:53:49.120\n You've got the All Secure Foundation, which is these guys are these guys are super dope.\n\n3:53:49.120 --> 3:53:50.900\n I'm going to read exactly because Jen text me.\n\n3:53:50.900 --> 3:53:54.860\n So Jen and Tom Satterly, I've had them both on the podcast.\n\n3:53:54.860 --> 3:53:58.080\n Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.\n\n3:53:58.080 --> 3:53:59.080\n Tom is a Delta.\n\n3:53:59.080 --> 3:54:00.080\n Have you heard of them?\n\n3:54:00.080 --> 3:54:01.080\n No.\n\n3:54:01.080 --> 3:54:02.080\n No.\n\n3:54:02.080 --> 3:54:03.080\n No.\n\n3:54:03.080 --> 3:54:04.080\n So, okay.\n\n3:54:04.080 --> 3:54:05.080\n So Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.\n\n3:54:05.080 --> 3:54:06.560\n It was one of his first operations.\n\n3:54:06.560 --> 3:54:08.360\n He's a Delta operator.\n\n3:54:08.360 --> 3:54:11.080\n And I asked her, I said, listen, I'm going to be doing these shows and I think it's great\n\n3:54:11.080 --> 3:54:12.200\n that we talk about you more.\n\n3:54:12.200 --> 3:54:15.520\n So I said, give me your three points of importance.\n\n3:54:15.520 --> 3:54:20.100\n So the All Secure Foundation serves special operations combat families in healing from\n\n3:54:20.100 --> 3:54:23.380\n post traumatic stress injury and secondary post traumatic stress.\n\n3:54:23.380 --> 3:54:27.680\n So that's often what the wife or the other husband or the other spouse suffers from.\n\n3:54:27.680 --> 3:54:31.260\n And we're starting to see that be more and more of an issue now.\n\n3:54:31.260 --> 3:54:35.240\n So they also are devoted to rebuilding the couple's relationships on the home front after\n\n3:54:35.240 --> 3:54:36.660\n the separations of war.\n\n3:54:36.660 --> 3:54:45.160\n And 80% of their warriors want their families to be more involved in the healing.\n\n3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:51.480\n The problem is, is very often vets don't realize that they can have, or just because the system\n\n3:54:51.480 --> 3:54:54.600\n doesn't pay for it, actually have their spouse as a part of things.\n\n3:54:54.600 --> 3:54:57.840\n And the biggest thing that we find with special operations families, I think the divorce rate\n\n3:54:57.840 --> 3:55:00.360\n is like 95%.\n\n3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:03.340\n And so they work so hard with these families.\n\n3:55:03.340 --> 3:55:06.480\n They take them on retreats, these husband and wives, and they get them to connect again\n\n3:55:06.480 --> 3:55:09.700\n after being separated over such a long period of time.\n\n3:55:09.700 --> 3:55:14.880\n There's other places like Children of Fallen Patriots out of DC, where they fund education,\n\n3:55:14.880 --> 3:55:20.080\n university for people who have lost their parents in deployments, whether their kid's\n\n3:55:20.080 --> 3:55:21.080\n even born yet.\n\n3:55:21.080 --> 3:55:23.040\n If they're still in utero, they still pay.\n\n3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:24.040\n They do not care.\n\n3:55:24.040 --> 3:55:30.200\n Then you've got people like in Canada, you've got Vets Canada, you've got in the States,\n\n3:55:30.200 --> 3:55:35.920\n you've got True Patriot Love, you've got, who else in the States is really great that\n\n3:55:35.920 --> 3:55:36.920\n we've worked with.\n\n3:55:36.920 --> 3:55:39.200\n I know there's a Green Beret Foundation that's great.\n\n3:55:39.200 --> 3:55:44.080\n One More Wave gives amputees, teaches them to surf with amputees.\n\n3:55:44.080 --> 3:55:45.260\n They're really great.\n\n3:55:45.260 --> 3:55:46.980\n There's so many organizations.\n\n3:55:46.980 --> 3:55:55.240\n But at the end of the day, I focus on a small subset because you cannot fix everyone's problems.\n\n3:55:55.240 --> 3:55:57.960\n The least you can do for people is focus.\n\n3:55:57.960 --> 3:56:01.360\n If you can provide focus, you can provide the proper amount of funding.\n\n3:56:01.360 --> 3:56:03.720\n Proper amount of funding can get the proper amount of tools.\n\n3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:08.700\n Those tools can actually be implemented properly and then those people can go on to hopefully\n\n3:56:08.700 --> 3:56:14.000\n have successful marriages and families and we don't have to watch our parents drink themselves\n\n3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:18.160\n to death and wonder why daddy's yelling at mommy all the time and daddy storms out and\n\n3:56:18.160 --> 3:56:19.160\n leaves.\n\n3:56:19.160 --> 3:56:22.100\n Well, daddy had some shit happen in his life and mommy had some shit happen, but that does\n\n3:56:22.100 --> 3:56:24.480\n not mean that's who they are.\n\n3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:31.880\n And yes, so trauma has completely destructive effects on family and relationships and correcting\n\n3:56:31.880 --> 3:56:34.640\n that as like ripple effects.\n\n3:56:34.640 --> 3:56:38.400\n Oh, just astronomical ripple effects.\n\n3:56:38.400 --> 3:56:44.120\n Because the problem is we are so quick to tell people they're suffering from PTSD.\n\n3:56:44.120 --> 3:56:45.800\n We're so quick to give them drugs.\n\n3:56:45.800 --> 3:56:48.360\n We're so quick to kick them out of the military.\n\n3:56:48.360 --> 3:56:50.300\n We're so quick to let them be homeless on the street.\n\n3:56:50.300 --> 3:56:52.340\n We're so quick to let them fucking kill themselves.\n\n3:56:52.340 --> 3:56:53.340\n We're so quick.\n\n3:56:53.340 --> 3:56:57.440\n And then all of a sudden, when when a politician goes, veteran suicide is an issue, that's\n\n3:56:57.440 --> 3:56:58.680\n when it's a problem.\n\n3:56:58.680 --> 3:57:02.160\n Well, if you prevent the problem from happening in the first place, or you give people the\n\n3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:05.800\n right funding and tools to do the job, you won't have this problem.\n\n3:57:05.800 --> 3:57:14.800\n Do you have advice for young people, think high school students, maybe undergrads, college\n\n3:57:14.800 --> 3:57:21.180\n students about career, life, how to live a life they can be proud of?\n\n3:57:21.180 --> 3:57:25.680\n You've had one heck of a life.\n\n3:57:25.680 --> 3:57:29.360\n Some of them are really cheesy, but they're true.\n\n3:57:29.360 --> 3:57:32.600\n Live a life you can be proud of, number one.\n\n3:57:32.600 --> 3:57:37.560\n If you wake up every morning and you hate what you do, change the fucking station.\n\n3:57:37.560 --> 3:57:41.440\n Do not live and stay in that perpetual cycle of bullshit.\n\n3:57:41.440 --> 3:57:42.440\n It's not worth it.\n\n3:57:42.440 --> 3:57:43.440\n It's not.\n\n3:57:43.440 --> 3:57:45.920\n It's not what you're on this planet for.\n\n3:57:45.920 --> 3:57:51.120\n You're worth more than that, than the monotony of waking up, going to work, hating your life,\n\n3:57:51.120 --> 3:57:54.160\n drinking yourself to sleep, and functioning.\n\n3:57:54.160 --> 3:57:55.220\n Do yourself a favor.\n\n3:57:55.220 --> 3:58:00.820\n The thing I scream about on the show so much is move your fucking body.\n\n3:58:00.820 --> 3:58:02.720\n Move your body.\n\n3:58:02.720 --> 3:58:04.480\n Get your blood moving.\n\n3:58:04.480 --> 3:58:07.440\n Allow your body to do what it's here for.\n\n3:58:07.440 --> 3:58:08.440\n Go for a run.\n\n3:58:08.440 --> 3:58:09.440\n Go for a walk.\n\n3:58:09.440 --> 3:58:13.800\n If you can't run, walk to the fridge three times more than maybe you did before, but\n\n3:58:13.800 --> 3:58:15.480\n you're moving.\n\n3:58:15.480 --> 3:58:20.000\n Pay attention to the shit you look at.\n\n3:58:20.000 --> 3:58:25.880\n More now than ever, we are seeing our younger generation just be force fed information from\n\n3:58:25.880 --> 3:58:28.720\n one side or the other, and none of it makes sense.\n\n3:58:28.720 --> 3:58:29.800\n None of it's understandable.\n\n3:58:29.800 --> 3:58:32.960\n It just causes chaos in the brain.\n\n3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:36.880\n Really pay attention to what you listen to.\n\n3:58:36.880 --> 3:58:42.360\n Something I've had to learn to do is make time for myself.\n\n3:58:42.360 --> 3:58:47.280\n All of this working 18 hours a day, not sleeping, just work, work, work.\n\n3:58:47.280 --> 3:58:48.280\n That doesn't work.\n\n3:58:48.280 --> 3:58:49.280\n That's not sustainable.\n\n3:58:49.280 --> 3:58:50.280\n That's not healthy.\n\n3:58:50.280 --> 3:58:52.680\n And it's not anything anyone should be doing.\n\n3:58:52.680 --> 3:58:55.360\n Balance is important.\n\n3:58:55.360 --> 3:59:00.760\n But if you're going to take the time to do something for yourself, don't make it sitting\n\n3:59:00.760 --> 3:59:05.120\n in front of the TV for six hours, eating a bag of chips, drinking a Coke.\n\n3:59:05.120 --> 3:59:09.960\n Make it, I'm going to go for a walk, maybe listen to a podcast where I can learn something.\n\n3:59:09.960 --> 3:59:12.520\n Make it, I'm going to go volunteer somewhere.\n\n3:59:12.520 --> 3:59:15.320\n Nobody does that anymore, but make it I can go volunteer somewhere.\n\n3:59:15.320 --> 3:59:18.120\n Honor House, they have no paid employees.\n\n3:59:18.120 --> 3:59:20.600\n They have one, everybody is a volunteer.\n\n3:59:20.600 --> 3:59:23.240\n They're fucking phenomenal.\n\n3:59:23.240 --> 3:59:26.040\n Just do whatever you're going to do.\n\n3:59:26.040 --> 3:59:31.460\n Do it with some fucking drive, put some goddamn effort into your life and pick something in\n\n3:59:31.460 --> 3:59:34.460\n a career that's going to make you happy.\n\n3:59:34.460 --> 3:59:36.960\n Not something that's just going to give you six figures because that's not going to make\n\n3:59:36.960 --> 3:59:37.960\n you happy.\n\n3:59:37.960 --> 3:59:41.280\n I can tell you right now, I have everything in the world and the last thing I want is\n\n3:59:41.280 --> 3:59:42.320\n more things.\n\n3:59:42.320 --> 3:59:43.320\n I want less.\n\n3:59:43.320 --> 3:59:48.160\n I want the woods and I want quiet because that's what's important to me.\n\n3:59:48.160 --> 3:59:53.920\n I want my family to matter, the people around me to matter, and the small group I keep,\n\n3:59:53.920 --> 3:59:58.640\n that tight knit I have, I want them to wake up every minute knowing that they have a friend\n\n3:59:58.640 --> 4:00:01.940\n that they can call on the other line that isn't just like, how's it going?\n\n4:00:01.940 --> 4:00:09.800\n That can actually have a conversation, a meaningful, intelligent, caring conversation.\n\n4:00:09.800 --> 4:00:16.480\n We are just breeding these kids to be followers who digest bullshit, who reverberate things\n\n4:00:16.480 --> 4:00:22.160\n they don't fully understand and have opinions on stuff they have no business talking about.\n\n4:00:22.160 --> 4:00:29.200\n Yeah, with an open mind, humbly think deeply about the world.\n\n4:00:29.200 --> 4:00:32.780\n How has your relationship with death changed?\n\n4:00:32.780 --> 4:00:36.180\n This is a Russian program, I have to ask you.\n\n4:00:36.180 --> 4:00:38.720\n So you've considered suicide throughout your life.\n\n4:00:38.720 --> 4:00:43.120\n You have been in the line of fire, you have witnessed death.\n\n4:00:43.120 --> 4:00:50.400\n You as a human being, a mortal one, do you think about your death these days now that\n\n4:00:50.400 --> 4:00:55.500\n you have begun the journey with dealing with your trauma?\n\n4:00:55.500 --> 4:00:57.960\n Do you think about your death?\n\n4:00:57.960 --> 4:01:01.400\n Are you afraid of your death?\n\n4:01:01.400 --> 4:01:02.960\n Well you don't die, so that's why.\n\n4:01:02.960 --> 4:01:05.380\n What do you mean you don't die?\n\n4:01:05.380 --> 4:01:06.380\n You move on.\n\n4:01:06.380 --> 4:01:08.640\n Where do you go?\n\n4:01:08.640 --> 4:01:13.480\n To another plane, and another vibration, and another whatever you want to call it.\n\n4:01:13.480 --> 4:01:14.480\n This isn't it.\n\n4:01:14.480 --> 4:01:16.000\n This isn't all of it.\n\n4:01:16.000 --> 4:01:17.420\n This is a blip.\n\n4:01:17.420 --> 4:01:18.640\n This is a moment.\n\n4:01:18.640 --> 4:01:19.640\n This is a...\n\n4:01:19.640 --> 4:01:22.760\n I used to be afraid of death before the military.\n\n4:01:22.760 --> 4:01:24.560\n I was always afraid of dying.\n\n4:01:24.560 --> 4:01:25.560\n I don't know why.\n\n4:01:25.560 --> 4:01:29.400\n I had this irrational fear that I was going to be kidnapped in my room, like seriously,\n\n4:01:29.400 --> 4:01:30.960\n like irrational fear, like afraid.\n\n4:01:30.960 --> 4:01:37.000\n And it's funny because I talked to Michaela yesterday and she said the same thing and\n\n4:01:37.000 --> 4:01:39.760\n I was like, oh my God, I know what you're talking about.\n\n4:01:39.760 --> 4:01:41.000\n Being afraid of being kidnapped?\n\n4:01:41.000 --> 4:01:45.760\n Yeah, she had this fear that someone was going to come in and take her out of her room.\n\n4:01:45.760 --> 4:01:46.760\n I had the same fear.\n\n4:01:46.760 --> 4:01:49.080\n By a human being or a monster of some kind?\n\n4:01:49.080 --> 4:01:50.440\n No, I think like by a human being.\n\n4:01:50.440 --> 4:01:54.980\n And I had this irrational fear that something was going to happen to me.\n\n4:01:54.980 --> 4:01:57.760\n And like I said, I don't know if it was because my parents were always made me aware of my\n\n4:01:57.760 --> 4:01:58.760\n surroundings.\n\n4:01:58.760 --> 4:01:59.760\n People take people.\n\n4:01:59.760 --> 4:02:01.320\n This is a real thing that happens.\n\n4:02:01.320 --> 4:02:03.820\n I was really small and I looked like a little boy.\n\n4:02:03.820 --> 4:02:06.120\n My hair was like that when I was training.\n\n4:02:06.120 --> 4:02:08.760\n I had short, no hair, flat as a board.\n\n4:02:08.760 --> 4:02:11.000\n You would have thought I was a 12 year old boy.\n\n4:02:11.000 --> 4:02:14.880\n And so my mom's like, people take people, sweetie, that's just the reality of life.\n\n4:02:14.880 --> 4:02:15.880\n You need to be aware.\n\n4:02:15.880 --> 4:02:18.080\n So I don't know if I had this ingrained in my mind.\n\n4:02:18.080 --> 4:02:21.640\n I was always like training to protect myself or fight someone off.\n\n4:02:21.640 --> 4:02:25.320\n So I was like afraid of like this irrational thing.\n\n4:02:25.320 --> 4:02:28.880\n And then I went overseas and then I realized that I could just be literally there talking\n\n4:02:28.880 --> 4:02:32.200\n to you, having a conversation, and I could just be taken off the face of the earth.\n\n4:02:32.200 --> 4:02:34.760\n And there's nothing I can do about it.\n\n4:02:34.760 --> 4:02:37.760\n And then I adopted this idea that when it's my time, it'll be my time.\n\n4:02:37.760 --> 4:02:50.400\n But the difference is now, at least I know that if I do go and I do cross and I am and\n\n4:02:50.400 --> 4:02:59.320\n I do move on, I know that I live my life the way that I always hoped I would be proud to\n\n4:02:59.320 --> 4:03:00.320\n live.\n\n4:03:00.320 --> 4:03:08.360\n Can I ask you a dark question because we, you mentioned Robin Williams, you mentioned\n\n4:03:08.360 --> 4:03:12.280\n Anthony Bourdain and your own struggle with suicide.\n\n4:03:12.280 --> 4:03:18.120\n Why do you think they ultimately lost the battle, that battle?\n\n4:03:18.120 --> 4:03:19.520\n Why do you think they took their lives?\n\n4:03:19.520 --> 4:03:25.800\n Man, that's a, that's a loaded question because you could look at everything from, from biomarkers\n\n4:03:25.800 --> 4:03:30.000\n in the brain to know if their serotonin and dopamine levels were crashed in the ground.\n\n4:03:30.000 --> 4:03:35.520\n Like there's, there's biological reasonings for some people where they're born bipolar\n\n4:03:35.520 --> 4:03:40.760\n and they have, or, you know, they're schizophrenic, like there's so many things we don't fully\n\n4:03:40.760 --> 4:03:43.800\n grasp about the brain.\n\n4:03:43.800 --> 4:03:52.960\n But what we do know from my perspective, for me at least, there really is no rhyme or reason\n\n4:03:52.960 --> 4:03:56.880\n why I survived and others didn't.\n\n4:03:56.880 --> 4:03:59.520\n Stuff and things don't make you happy.\n\n4:03:59.520 --> 4:04:05.240\n People don't always know why they're feeling the way they're feeling, but they also are,\n\n4:04:05.240 --> 4:04:15.160\n also are not always willing to talk about it or be, they put on a good front.\n\n4:04:15.160 --> 4:04:18.400\n And if nobody knows any different, what do you expect?\n\n4:04:18.400 --> 4:04:24.240\n And it's especially clear with the, the two of them that on the surface they're, you know,\n\n4:04:24.240 --> 4:04:29.160\n exceptionally successful in so many dimensions and still that means nothing.\n\n4:04:29.160 --> 4:04:36.080\n Well possessions, anything really is not, doesn't guarantee you happiness.\n\n4:04:36.080 --> 4:04:38.840\n No, it doesn't.\n\n4:04:38.840 --> 4:04:49.120\n Well that's terrifying, but when it's good, that's what makes it joyful.\n\n4:04:49.120 --> 4:04:54.840\n Like that's what happiness is, is like holy shit somehow amidst all the absurdity, all\n\n4:04:54.840 --> 4:04:59.040\n the things that you can't predict, you, you nevertheless feel really good.\n\n4:04:59.040 --> 4:05:05.080\n That's why I feel really fortunate to be getting this feat of happiness all the time.\n\n4:05:05.080 --> 4:05:10.160\n Well to be or not to be, that's a good place to end it.\n\n4:05:10.160 --> 4:05:13.200\n Kelsey, you're an amazing human being.\n\n4:05:13.200 --> 4:05:18.080\n I'm really fortunate that you would spend your valuable time with me.\n\n4:05:18.080 --> 4:05:23.360\n As I said, you're so good at not just talking, but listening.\n\n4:05:23.360 --> 4:05:27.880\n So I definitely will listen to your podcast because I can tell you're an incredible person\n\n4:05:27.880 --> 4:05:30.920\n as an interviewer and as a storyteller.\n\n4:05:30.920 --> 4:05:33.640\n So again, thank you for talking today.\n\n4:05:33.640 --> 4:05:36.640\n Thank you so much, bye.\n\n4:05:36.640 --> 4:05:39.280\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kelsey Sharon.\n\n4:05:39.280 --> 4:05:43.280\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n4:05:43.280 --> 4:05:47.720\n And now let me leave you with some words from Herbert Hoover.\n\n4:05:47.720 --> 4:05:54.640\n Older men declare war, but it is the youth that must fight and die.\n\n4:05:54.640 --> 4:05:57.960\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
