Oh, geez.\n\n00:47.160 --> 00:48.440\n No hello, no nothing.\n\n00:48.440 --> 00:50.040\n Nope. I thought I was robotic.\n\n00:51.600 --> 00:54.840\n Bukowski said, love is a fog that burns away\n\n00:54.840 --> 00:57.160\n with the first daylight of reality.\n\n00:57.160 --> 01:00.520\n So Mark Normand, let me first ask you about love.\n\n01:01.680 --> 01:02.860\n What are your thoughts about love?\n\n01:02.860 --> 01:05.300\n You talk about your relationships quite a bit.\n\n01:05.300 --> 01:07.640\n Do you think love can last?\n\n01:07.640 --> 01:10.760\n I do, but I think it's work.\n\n01:10.760 --> 01:13.520\n Everybody wants love to be this prepackaged,\n\n01:13.520 --> 01:16.920\n perfect euphoric thing, but you gotta,\n\n01:18.040 --> 01:20.160\n it's like a good body, you know?\n\n01:20.160 --> 01:21.620\n We're all born with a good body,\n\n01:21.620 --> 01:22.960\n but you gotta keep it in shape.\n\n01:22.960 --> 01:25.840\n And it's the same with a loving relationship.\n\n01:25.840 --> 01:27.360\n I think you.\n\n01:27.360 --> 01:30.200\n Nobody wants to do the work, that's the problem.\n\n01:30.200 --> 01:32.440\n You talked about, I think you told a story\n\n01:32.440 --> 01:35.280\n about being unfaithful to a previous girlfriend\n\n01:35.280 --> 01:36.680\n or something like that.\n\n01:36.680 --> 01:41.360\n I think the story goes that you were like drifting apart.\n\n01:41.360 --> 01:42.240\n Who were you talking to?\n\n01:42.240 --> 01:44.120\n Burt Kreischer maybe or something like that?\n\n01:44.120 --> 01:46.040\n Oh yeah, we were high school sweethearts,\n\n01:46.040 --> 01:48.720\n dated for like 12 years and then.\n\n01:48.720 --> 01:50.040\n So that wasn't love anymore.\n\n01:50.040 --> 01:51.600\n That was more like relationship, that was like.\n\n01:51.600 --> 01:53.320\n It was comfort, it was routine.\n\n01:53.320 --> 01:57.960\n And we just slipped into that married life autopilot world.\n\n01:57.960 --> 02:02.960\n And I tried to break up, I think, and it didn't take.\n\n02:03.040 --> 02:04.400\n It was one of those things.\n\n02:04.400 --> 02:07.480\n Our lives are just so baked in.\n\n02:07.480 --> 02:10.680\n And then I think I cheated and she caught me\n\n02:10.680 --> 02:11.640\n and it was ugly.\n\n02:11.640 --> 02:13.620\n And then we went to therapy to try to work it out,\n\n02:13.620 --> 02:16.440\n but it's much like a car that gets into a wreck.\n\n02:16.440 --> 02:18.760\n The door just never closed the same.\n\n02:18.760 --> 02:19.680\n You know what I mean?\n\n02:19.680 --> 02:23.480\n Yeah, so what are your thoughts about then commitment\n\n02:23.480 --> 02:25.720\n like outside of love marriage?\n\n02:25.720 --> 02:27.480\n I think it's an antiquated idea.\n\n02:27.480 --> 02:30.680\n I think it's kind of silly and unrealistic.\n\n02:30.680 --> 02:31.880\n And I think we're coming out of that\n\n02:31.880 --> 02:34.600\n as we get all polyamorous and non binary\n\n02:34.600 --> 02:36.040\n and queefy and all this stuff.\n\n02:36.040 --> 02:38.660\n I think we're slowly moving away from that.\n\n02:38.660 --> 02:41.240\n But I think a lot of the ladies,\n\n02:41.240 --> 02:45.400\n more majority women like marriage, like the idea of it.\n\n02:45.400 --> 02:48.640\n Like I'm a fiance now or whatever you call it.\n\n02:48.640 --> 02:49.840\n I'm engaged.\n\n02:49.840 --> 02:54.600\n And I mean, she is just woo wee going hog wild.\n\n02:54.600 --> 02:55.440\n She's loving it.\n\n02:55.440 --> 02:57.720\n She's got the dress thing, pick a venue flower\n\n02:57.720 --> 03:00.600\n and she's deep in whereas I feel guilty\n\n03:00.600 --> 03:03.200\n because I'm just like, ah, geez.\n\n03:04.600 --> 03:05.440\n Is it planned already?\n\n03:05.440 --> 03:06.280\n When's the wedding?\n\n03:06.280 --> 03:08.920\n You see Squid Game, I'm just living life.\n\n03:08.920 --> 03:11.580\n Yeah, it's planned.\n\n03:11.580 --> 03:12.420\n It's in New Orleans.\n\n03:12.420 --> 03:14.980\n I'm from there and it's next year.\n\n03:15.960 --> 03:16.880\n Are you married?\n\n03:16.880 --> 03:17.760\n No, single.\n\n03:17.760 --> 03:19.320\n Virgin?\n\n03:19.320 --> 03:20.160\n Of course, yeah.\n\n03:20.160 --> 03:20.980\n I can't imagine.\n\n03:20.980 --> 03:21.880\n I bet you'd be great in bed.\n\n03:21.880 --> 03:23.080\n You're ripped.\n\n03:23.080 --> 03:24.560\n Best hairline in podcasting.\n\n03:25.520 --> 03:26.360\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n03:26.360 --> 03:27.180\n I haven't tried yet.\n\n03:27.180 --> 03:28.020\n So we'll have to see.\n\n03:28.020 --> 03:28.860\n All right, well, let me know.\n\n03:28.860 --> 03:30.840\n Pretty big hog on you?\n\n03:30.840 --> 03:35.840\n Yeah, I could see you packing a crazy, crazy tool downtown.\n\n03:36.760 --> 03:38.280\n That matters to girls?\n\n03:38.280 --> 03:41.320\n Apparently, yeah, that's all I hear about.\n\n03:41.320 --> 03:42.700\n Okay, New Orleans.\n\n03:42.700 --> 03:43.780\n You grew up in New Orleans?\n\n03:43.780 --> 03:45.280\n Yeah, born and raised.\n\n03:46.200 --> 03:47.640\n Treme outside the French Quarter.\n\n03:47.640 --> 03:48.480\n Have you ever been?\n\n03:48.480 --> 03:50.560\n Yeah, don't remember it.\n\n03:50.560 --> 03:51.680\n Oh, you drink?\n\n03:51.680 --> 03:52.500\n Yeah, I drink.\n\n03:52.500 --> 03:53.340\n Of course I drink.\n\n03:53.340 --> 03:54.960\n I don't know, I can't tell if you have fun.\n\n03:54.960 --> 03:56.000\n No, not really.\n\n03:56.000 --> 03:58.480\n But in Russia, of course I drink vodka,\n\n03:58.480 --> 03:59.320\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n03:59.320 --> 04:00.140\n Oh, right, in Russia.\n\n04:00.140 --> 04:00.980\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n04:00.980 --> 04:01.800\n Yes.\n\n04:01.800 --> 04:02.640\n Gotta know.\n\n04:02.640 --> 04:03.480\n Vodka.\n\n04:03.480 --> 04:05.480\n Beer was just labeled an alcoholic beverage in 2011.\n\n04:05.480 --> 04:06.440\n Fun fact.\n\n04:06.440 --> 04:07.280\n What do you mean?\n\n04:07.280 --> 04:08.440\n In Russia.\n\n04:08.440 --> 04:09.320\n It was just drinks.\n\n04:09.320 --> 04:10.880\n It was just like apple juice before.\n\n04:10.880 --> 04:14.140\n It finally got declared legally as an alcoholic beverage.\n\n04:14.140 --> 04:18.420\n Which means you can regulate it, that kind of thing.\n\n04:18.420 --> 04:19.520\n I guess so.\n\n04:19.520 --> 04:20.360\n Yeah.\n\n04:20.360 --> 04:21.200\n See, that's where your brain goes.\n\n04:21.200 --> 04:22.020\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n04:22.020 --> 04:22.860\n I just go, oh, these fucking Ruskies are.\n\n04:22.860 --> 04:25.540\n I didn't even know there was rules about drinking.\n\n04:25.540 --> 04:27.620\n This is good, I'm learning about Russia from you.\n\n04:27.620 --> 04:31.940\n So what's the difficult memory, experience from childhood\n\n04:31.940 --> 04:36.940\n in New Orleans that made you the man you are today?\n\n04:38.580 --> 04:39.820\n I don't know if it made me the man,\n\n04:39.820 --> 04:44.820\n but jeez, I had a lot of scuffles in the neighborhood.\n\n04:45.900 --> 04:47.440\n I was the white kid in the neighborhood.\n\n04:47.440 --> 04:51.660\n So I was automatically the odd man out, the minority,\n\n04:51.660 --> 04:54.860\n the weirdo, the dork, the dweeb, the honky.\n\n04:54.860 --> 04:58.860\n So just a lot of memories of like getting slapped\n\n04:58.860 --> 05:01.340\n in the face by guys and just having to take it\n\n05:01.340 --> 05:02.860\n because there's like five guys there.\n\n05:02.860 --> 05:04.900\n And they'd be like, oh, look, you didn't even fight back.\n\n05:04.900 --> 05:06.260\n And you're like, what am I going to do?\n\n05:06.260 --> 05:07.920\n Hit you and then get beat up by these guys?\n\n05:07.920 --> 05:12.220\n So a lot of that stuff was a big bummer growing up.\n\n05:12.220 --> 05:16.100\n Got robbed all the time, lost a lot of bicycles,\n\n05:16.100 --> 05:19.440\n had a bicycle taken from under me, that was pretty brutal.\n\n05:19.440 --> 05:22.380\n These kids pulled up, you know, they're like 17\n\n05:22.380 --> 05:27.120\n and I was 13 and I had a face paint on.\n\n05:27.120 --> 05:30.220\n Like I had a, not black face, but I was at a summer camp\n\n05:30.220 --> 05:32.480\n and I had a rainbow face painted on me.\n\n05:32.480 --> 05:34.080\n We were helping kids that day.\n\n05:34.080 --> 05:36.480\n So I let them put paint on me.\n\n05:36.480 --> 05:38.040\n And so now I'm riding home.\n\n05:38.040 --> 05:40.980\n What a mark, what a goober I am.\n\n05:40.980 --> 05:43.020\n I'm riding home and these guys see me a mile away.\n\n05:43.020 --> 05:44.900\n I'm a sitting duck and they go, we can take his bike.\n\n05:44.900 --> 05:47.000\n He's got a fucking rainbow on his cheek.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:50.700\n So they just go, hey, you know, like cut in front of you.\n\n05:50.700 --> 05:51.780\n They go, let me try your bike.\n\n05:51.780 --> 05:53.140\n I go, I'm good, I'm good.\n\n05:53.140 --> 05:54.480\n I knew what they wanted.\n\n05:54.480 --> 05:56.260\n And they go, let me try the bike.\n\n05:56.260 --> 05:58.420\n And then they just pushed me and took the bike.\n\n05:58.420 --> 06:02.180\n So stuff like that was really shaping the insecurity,\n\n06:02.180 --> 06:04.000\n the self worth.\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:09.000\n Did it, cause I've been mugged when I was younger too.\n\n06:09.380 --> 06:10.400\n Really?\n\n06:10.400 --> 06:13.660\n Yeah, it changes your view of human nature a little bit.\n\n06:13.660 --> 06:14.500\n For sure.\n\n06:14.500 --> 06:16.820\n You go, wow, I didn't know people could be this mean.\n\n06:16.820 --> 06:17.880\n This cool.\n\n06:17.880 --> 06:18.720\n Yeah.\n\n06:18.720 --> 06:19.540\n Inconsiderate.\n\n06:19.540 --> 06:20.380\n I'm always worried about it.\n\n06:20.380 --> 06:21.380\n Did I fart too much?\n\n06:21.380 --> 06:22.560\n Am I annoying?\n\n06:22.560 --> 06:23.820\n Am I pissing this guy off?\n\n06:23.820 --> 06:25.540\n But what a way to live.\n\n06:25.540 --> 06:28.340\n Just, I want the bike, I'm taking it.\n\n06:28.340 --> 06:30.040\n Fuck his feelings.\n\n06:30.040 --> 06:33.580\n For me, that quickly turned into realizing\n\n06:33.580 --> 06:36.660\n that that's just a temporary phase that those folks are in.\n\n06:36.660 --> 06:39.980\n Like they have a capacity to be good.\n\n06:39.980 --> 06:40.820\n Sure.\n\n06:40.820 --> 06:43.860\n For some reason, for me, that was a motivation to see,\n\n06:43.860 --> 06:47.540\n can we discover, can we incentivize them\n\n06:47.540 --> 06:49.500\n to find like a better path in life?\n\n06:49.500 --> 06:53.380\n Like I wasn't like all like, I don't know, Gandhi about it.\n\n06:53.380 --> 06:55.540\n Of course I was pissed and all those kinds of things,\n\n06:55.540 --> 07:00.540\n but I don't know, it seemed like just the kind of thing\n\n07:01.640 --> 07:03.420\n you might do when you're younger.\n\n07:03.420 --> 07:04.260\n You hope.\n\n07:04.260 --> 07:07.780\n But this is adult crime, obviously.\n\n07:07.780 --> 07:09.340\n Yeah, I know, but yeah, exactly.\n\n07:09.340 --> 07:12.080\n And then it solidifies and then you're beyond saving\n\n07:12.080 --> 07:14.820\n at some point, but it's like, there's always,\n\n07:14.820 --> 07:19.820\n there's always an opportunity to make a better life\n\n07:19.980 --> 07:22.940\n for yourself, to become a better version of yourself.\n\n07:22.940 --> 07:25.620\n Yeah, and I remember coming home crying with no bike\n\n07:25.620 --> 07:29.780\n and my mom, my parents are like liberal to a fault.\n\n07:29.780 --> 07:31.820\n You know, where they were like, oh, well they need it.\n\n07:31.820 --> 07:33.620\n They're poor kids in the neighborhood.\n\n07:33.620 --> 07:36.620\n And you're like, all right, but I also like have a bicycle\n\n07:36.620 --> 07:39.100\n that I ride around, you know, and I also like to live\n\n07:39.100 --> 07:42.900\n in an area that's not just, you know, riddled with theft\n\n07:42.900 --> 07:45.780\n and vandalism, but they were just like, oh, they need it.\n\n07:45.780 --> 07:48.120\n And then it was a moot point, we just moved on.\n\n07:48.120 --> 07:49.880\n So I remember very young being like, all right,\n\n07:49.880 --> 07:51.700\n I gotta figure my shit out.\n\n07:53.380 --> 07:56.500\n Okay, so you said you were beat up quite a bit,\n\n07:56.500 --> 07:57.580\n like bullying and stuff.\n\n07:57.580 --> 07:59.980\n Pushed around, I was never hospitalized or anything,\n\n07:59.980 --> 08:02.380\n but you know, you get a black guy here and there\n\n08:02.380 --> 08:04.180\n and a bloody nose, stuff like that.\n\n08:04.180 --> 08:05.900\n And it was just the outnumbered thing.\n\n08:05.900 --> 08:08.180\n The violence didn't really bother me\n\n08:08.180 --> 08:10.300\n because you're just kids, you're boys.\n\n08:10.300 --> 08:14.140\n But it was the predatory, let's get him.\n\n08:14.140 --> 08:15.980\n You know, we can take him down.\n\n08:15.980 --> 08:17.860\n He's, you know, he's an easy target.\n\n08:17.860 --> 08:20.320\n That's what kills you, the mental part.\n\n08:22.340 --> 08:25.260\n Yeah, you know, until you actually said I didn't realize,\n\n08:25.260 --> 08:28.380\n I've been in, what do you call them, scuffles.\n\n08:28.380 --> 08:32.220\n And there was just one that stands out to me where, yeah.\n\n08:32.220 --> 08:34.660\n Let's hear it, Faddy, bring it on.\n\n08:34.660 --> 08:36.980\n And you do jujitsu and all that stuff, right?\n\n08:36.980 --> 08:38.980\n Yeah, I can see the guns through the suit,\n\n08:38.980 --> 08:40.100\n you're like John Wick.\n\n08:40.100 --> 08:42.680\n All right, well, I used to have,\n\n08:42.680 --> 08:43.940\n now you're gonna start making fun of me,\n\n08:43.940 --> 08:46.340\n I used to have long hair for like a couple of years.\n\n08:46.340 --> 08:48.620\n I was in a band playing music and stuff like that.\n\n08:48.620 --> 08:51.860\n And there was, like most of the fights I've been in\n\n08:51.860 --> 08:54.980\n were basically one on one, maybe a little bit like,\n\n08:54.980 --> 08:58.780\n a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered.\n\n08:58.780 --> 09:00.700\n And this one particular time,\n\n09:01.660 --> 09:02.940\n I've learned a lot of lessons,\n\n09:02.940 --> 09:06.020\n but one of them was, there was a fight started\n\n09:06.020 --> 09:08.180\n between me and this other person.\n\n09:08.180 --> 09:12.340\n And then his buddies, I guess, were there.\n\n09:12.340 --> 09:13.980\n And they, as opposed to like breaking it up\n\n09:13.980 --> 09:18.980\n or letting it happen, one of them grabbed my hair.\n\n09:19.340 --> 09:20.940\n It's the first time anybody grabbed,\n\n09:20.940 --> 09:22.940\n like used my hair in a fight,\n\n09:22.940 --> 09:25.340\n which I haven't since then realized that that's actually\n\n09:25.340 --> 09:27.660\n a really powerful grip and a powerful weapon.\n\n09:27.660 --> 09:29.140\n Oh, very vulnerable of you.\n\n09:29.140 --> 09:31.560\n And then my head got pulled back\n\n09:31.560 --> 09:32.640\n and they pulled me down to the ground.\n\n09:32.640 --> 09:34.420\n Like I couldn't do anything, it was so,\n\n09:34.420 --> 09:36.940\n I remember being exceptionally frustrated.\n\n09:36.940 --> 09:37.780\n Yes.\n\n09:37.780 --> 09:40.460\n That was the feeling like, I can't do anything here.\n\n09:40.460 --> 09:42.340\n I'm like trapped.\n\n09:42.340 --> 09:44.780\n And then they were just like kicking me and hitting me\n\n09:44.780 --> 09:45.620\n and stuff like that.\n\n09:45.620 --> 09:47.460\n And the outnumbered part of it,\n\n09:49.060 --> 09:51.440\n because I always kind of remember the trapped part\n\n09:51.440 --> 09:55.100\n because I just hated from a fighting grappling perspective,\n\n09:55.980 --> 09:58.700\n how like, the feeling was this isn't fair.\n\n09:58.700 --> 09:59.940\n Yes, that's what it is.\n\n09:59.940 --> 10:04.160\n It's a deep, deep unfairness that you just can't win.\n\n10:04.160 --> 10:05.460\n The mob wins.\n\n10:05.460 --> 10:06.780\n Yeah, the mob wins.\n\n10:06.780 --> 10:07.860\n Scary stuff.\n\n10:07.860 --> 10:09.980\n But it makes a man out of you in a weird way\n\n10:09.980 --> 10:12.340\n that builds character, you realize life isn't fair early\n\n10:12.340 --> 10:14.700\n and you go on from there.\n\n10:14.700 --> 10:15.940\n So there's something there.\n\n10:15.940 --> 10:16.980\n And look at you today.\n\n10:16.980 --> 10:19.220\n They're probably eating out of a dumpster\n\n10:19.220 --> 10:21.100\n at a Krispy Kreme and you're here,\n\n10:21.100 --> 10:23.560\n got eight podcasts, you're doing great,\n\n10:23.560 --> 10:26.680\n talking to giant titans of the industry.\n\n10:26.680 --> 10:29.520\n No, I do remember returning home that night.\n\n10:29.520 --> 10:31.580\n I mean that you said you were crying.\n\n10:31.580 --> 10:33.140\n That's really formative.\n\n10:33.140 --> 10:35.440\n Like that's the point in which you get to decide\n\n10:35.440 --> 10:37.100\n what do I make of this moment?\n\n10:37.100 --> 10:38.520\n I mean, especially when you're younger,\n\n10:38.520 --> 10:40.780\n maybe it's not presented to you that way,\n\n10:40.780 --> 10:43.540\n but like some of the greatest people in history\n\n10:44.460 --> 10:47.220\n were bullied in these kinds of ways.\n\n10:47.220 --> 10:48.980\n And they made something of themselves in this moment,\n\n10:48.980 --> 10:51.580\n like bullied by life in some kind of way.\n\n10:51.580 --> 10:53.300\n It's like an opportunity for growth.\n\n10:53.300 --> 10:58.180\n It's weird, but like hardship even in small doses\n\n10:58.180 --> 11:00.120\n is like an opportunity for growth.\n\n11:00.120 --> 11:01.560\n Totally, I mean, look at Richard Pryor.\n\n11:01.560 --> 11:03.620\n They say he's labeled as the best comedian of all time.\n\n11:03.620 --> 11:04.760\n Grew up in a whorehouse,\n\n11:04.760 --> 11:07.220\n watch his mom get plowed by these guys\n\n11:07.220 --> 11:10.920\n in the middle of Indiana, I wanna say.\n\n11:10.920 --> 11:12.740\n And just who had a harder life?\n\n11:12.740 --> 11:14.060\n He would suck dick for drugs,\n\n11:14.060 --> 11:17.380\n all this stuff growing up, beat up.\n\n11:17.380 --> 11:20.340\n And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry,\n\n11:20.340 --> 11:22.380\n that's my birth control alarm.\n\n11:22.380 --> 11:24.460\n And then the whole world is like trying\n\n11:24.460 --> 11:27.080\n to get rid of bullying, but we still do bullying,\n\n11:27.080 --> 11:28.700\n but now it's accepted bullying.\n\n11:28.700 --> 11:29.940\n It's very strange.\n\n11:29.940 --> 11:33.140\n So you're a proponent of beating kids up,\n\n11:33.140 --> 11:33.980\n is that what you're saying?\n\n11:33.980 --> 11:35.540\n Yes, and sex with them.\n\n11:35.540 --> 11:36.820\n All right.\n\n11:36.820 --> 11:40.600\n But no, I just think it's part of life\n\n11:40.600 --> 11:43.100\n and it's horrible, it's like rain, you gotta have it.\n\n11:43.100 --> 11:45.420\n Look, a rainy day is a bummer, but you need it.\n\n11:45.420 --> 11:47.820\n And I think it's similar to that.\n\n11:49.100 --> 11:53.020\n What was your relationship like with your mom, your dad?\n\n11:53.020 --> 11:54.900\n What are some memorable moments with them?\n\n11:54.900 --> 11:56.020\n What did you learn from them?\n\n11:56.020 --> 11:59.400\n Good parents, they're giving, thoughtful.\n\n12:01.740 --> 12:05.140\n A little out to lunch, they were workaholics,\n\n12:05.140 --> 12:08.600\n so it was hard to get a lot out of them.\n\n12:08.600 --> 12:10.540\n And my dad was kind of an angry dad.\n\n12:10.540 --> 12:13.340\n I think he just had like a weird childhood\n\n12:13.340 --> 12:14.460\n and he's just trying to make it\n\n12:14.460 --> 12:16.780\n and he's trying to provide, but it's hard.\n\n12:16.780 --> 12:18.780\n And we live in this horrible neighborhood\n\n12:18.780 --> 12:20.620\n and we're getting robbed all the time.\n\n12:22.260 --> 12:24.420\n So life was kind of coming down on him all the time.\n\n12:24.420 --> 12:27.900\n So then he'll take it out on you or whoever, he would snap.\n\n12:27.900 --> 12:31.180\n But great parents, they cared, they put us first,\n\n12:32.060 --> 12:36.940\n but there wasn't a lot of, you ever go to a friend's house\n\n12:36.940 --> 12:39.220\n as a kid and there's like a picture of a ski trip\n\n12:39.220 --> 12:40.780\n and you're like, ski trip?\n\n12:40.780 --> 12:42.620\n What the hell is that about?\n\n12:42.620 --> 12:46.460\n It wasn't a lot of that and smart, very smart people,\n\n12:46.460 --> 12:49.620\n but I don't know how well they were at socializing.\n\n12:49.620 --> 12:51.220\n So you never like bonded with them\n\n12:51.220 --> 12:53.020\n like on a deep human level?\n\n12:53.020 --> 12:54.580\n Some bonding, but rarely deep.\n\n12:54.580 --> 12:57.300\n Yeah, it was just almost coworker.\n\n12:57.300 --> 12:59.300\n Hey, cold out, huh?\n\n12:59.300 --> 13:00.140\n What?\n\n13:00.140 --> 13:01.300\n It's cold out, huh?\n\n13:01.300 --> 13:02.260\n Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff.\n\n13:02.260 --> 13:03.100\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n13:03.100 --> 13:03.920\n Yeah, yeah, I got you.\n\n13:03.920 --> 13:06.340\n Get there a little bit, but my parents are done.\n\n13:06.340 --> 13:08.780\n I hope they never saw this, but they would do a thing\n\n13:08.780 --> 13:10.740\n where my dad especially would do a thing\n\n13:10.740 --> 13:13.340\n where he would, he knew how to cut you down\n\n13:13.340 --> 13:15.940\n right to the bone and so after a while you're like,\n\n13:15.940 --> 13:17.180\n I'm not even gonna interact with this guy\n\n13:17.180 --> 13:19.980\n because he can get you so well.\n\n13:19.980 --> 13:22.300\n One time we were at like a Thanksgiving,\n\n13:22.300 --> 13:25.480\n some kind of family event and all the cousins are there\n\n13:25.480 --> 13:26.820\n and I remember I was holding court.\n\n13:26.820 --> 13:30.240\n I was a young boy finding my comedic legs\n\n13:30.240 --> 13:33.660\n in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family\n\n13:33.660 --> 13:38.040\n and I was killing and my dad comes out and he goes,\n\n13:38.040 --> 13:39.620\n what are you holding court?\n\n13:39.620 --> 13:42.540\n And I was like, ah, and I felt like I was this big.\n\n13:42.540 --> 13:44.140\n I just whoo, shrunk down.\n\n13:44.140 --> 13:45.700\n He just nailed it because in my head I'm like,\n\n13:45.700 --> 13:47.680\n I'm holding court, look at me, I got the whole room\n\n13:47.680 --> 13:49.980\n and he goes, what are you, what are you holding court here?\n\n13:49.980 --> 13:51.500\n And I'm like, who the hell do you think you are?\n\n13:51.500 --> 13:53.980\n And I was like, he's right, I shouldn't be holding court,\n\n13:53.980 --> 13:55.380\n who the fuck am I, I'm nobody.\n\n13:55.380 --> 13:57.560\n So stuff like that.\n\n13:57.560 --> 13:58.700\n Was he aware of that you think?\n\n13:58.700 --> 14:01.300\n He wasn't, he wasn't, I don't think he was, but.\n\n14:01.300 --> 14:06.340\n Do you give parents a pass when they're unaware\n\n14:06.340 --> 14:09.540\n of the destructive, like is it better when they're unaware?\n\n14:09.540 --> 14:11.160\n Because it seems like that's the way.\n\n14:11.160 --> 14:12.000\n That's true.\n\n14:12.000 --> 14:13.900\n That's the way parents often fail\n\n14:13.900 --> 14:18.260\n is they're not intentionally malevolent,\n\n14:18.260 --> 14:20.140\n they're just like clueless.\n\n14:20.140 --> 14:22.780\n Yeah, it's a bittersweet thing\n\n14:22.780 --> 14:24.360\n because you're like, well, okay, he's not malicious,\n\n14:24.360 --> 14:26.060\n he's not trying to hurt me,\n\n14:26.060 --> 14:29.940\n but also he doesn't know he hurt me.\n\n14:29.940 --> 14:31.260\n I don't know, it's tough\n\n14:31.260 --> 14:33.660\n because if he was trying to hurt you,\n\n14:33.660 --> 14:35.460\n I guess that would be worse.\n\n14:35.460 --> 14:39.500\n So you're the fully baked Mark Norman cake at this point\n\n14:39.500 --> 14:41.880\n Yeah, it's a shitty cake.\n\n14:43.820 --> 14:45.360\n Fruit salad.\n\n14:45.360 --> 14:47.860\n You know, the sense of self worth you mentioned.\n\n14:49.740 --> 14:50.980\n I think in your comedy,\n\n14:50.980 --> 14:52.900\n there's a sense like you hate yourself.\n\n14:52.900 --> 14:54.140\n You think?\n\n14:54.140 --> 14:55.340\n I didn't know if that came through.\n\n14:55.340 --> 14:57.380\n Shit, I was trying to hide that part.\n\n14:57.380 --> 14:58.280\n God damn it.\n\n14:58.280 --> 15:01.540\n I mean, when you like in the privacy of your own mind,\n\n15:02.480 --> 15:07.300\n are you able to love yourself or is it mostly self hate?\n\n15:07.300 --> 15:09.020\n Jeez, what happened to this podcast?\n\n15:09.020 --> 15:11.100\n I didn't know I was on Dr. Phil.\n\n15:11.100 --> 15:11.940\n Dr. Phil.\n\n15:11.940 --> 15:13.580\n I thought we were gonna talk about engineering\n\n15:13.580 --> 15:17.140\n and climate change and rockets.\n\n15:17.140 --> 15:17.980\n We'll get there.\n\n15:17.980 --> 15:18.800\n Okay.\n\n15:18.800 --> 15:20.020\n Starts with love, goes to rockets.\n\n15:20.020 --> 15:21.220\n All right, I like that.\n\n15:21.220 --> 15:22.420\n I like that's a t shirt.\n\n15:24.940 --> 15:25.780\n I mean, like.\n\n15:25.780 --> 15:26.600\n What's the question?\n\n15:26.600 --> 15:27.900\n Sorry.\n\n15:27.900 --> 15:29.100\n Do I feel love?\n\n15:29.100 --> 15:29.940\n No, no, like.\n\n15:29.940 --> 15:31.180\n Do I love myself?\n\n15:31.180 --> 15:36.060\n Yeah, yeah, so are you like this engine\n\n15:36.060 --> 15:37.780\n of being self critical\n\n15:37.780 --> 15:40.700\n of just being constantly anxious\n\n15:40.700 --> 15:43.940\n about how the world perceives you, these kinds of things?\n\n15:43.940 --> 15:47.260\n Is this something that you just go to for comedy\n\n15:47.260 --> 15:50.180\n or is this who you are as a human being?\n\n15:50.180 --> 15:52.100\n I think I don't wanna explore it.\n\n15:52.100 --> 15:54.140\n I think I get around it.\n\n15:54.140 --> 15:55.360\n You know, I tap dance around it,\n\n15:55.360 --> 15:57.940\n but I get it out a little with my act maybe,\n\n15:57.940 --> 15:59.380\n because I can't do it.\n\n15:59.380 --> 16:00.580\n I'm not doing it in real life.\n\n16:00.580 --> 16:04.780\n So I'll get out this no love, not loving myself.\n\n16:04.780 --> 16:06.140\n I don't know who wants to love themself.\n\n16:06.140 --> 16:07.500\n Everybody always like you gotta love yourself.\n\n16:07.500 --> 16:09.060\n And then when you meet somebody who does love yourself,\n\n16:09.060 --> 16:11.300\n you're like, I fucking hate this guy.\n\n16:11.300 --> 16:12.660\n Don't you hate the guy who's upset?\n\n16:12.660 --> 16:14.420\n I'm great, I'm awesome.\n\n16:14.420 --> 16:15.260\n Life is good.\n\n16:15.260 --> 16:17.100\n You're like, ah, this guy sucks.\n\n16:17.100 --> 16:18.940\n I'd rather an insecure guy.\n\n16:18.940 --> 16:20.180\n So maybe I wanna stay insecure.\n\n16:20.180 --> 16:22.740\n Maybe I don't wanna find this love for myself.\n\n16:22.740 --> 16:23.780\n Well, okay.\n\n16:23.780 --> 16:27.820\n So self love, like just appreciating who you are,\n\n16:27.820 --> 16:30.060\n or like appreciating the moment of being grateful\n\n16:30.060 --> 16:32.100\n doesn't have to express itself\n\n16:32.100 --> 16:34.720\n by the guy saying I'm awesome.\n\n16:34.720 --> 16:35.560\n True.\n\n16:35.560 --> 16:36.580\n It's more just like humility.\n\n16:36.580 --> 16:38.420\n It's just like walking calmly through the world\n\n16:38.420 --> 16:39.860\n and just being grateful to be alive,\n\n16:39.860 --> 16:40.700\n that kind of thing.\n\n16:40.700 --> 16:42.220\n That's good.\n\n16:42.220 --> 16:43.700\n And like, oh, being appreciative\n\n16:43.700 --> 16:45.140\n of all the accomplishments you've made so far.\n\n16:45.140 --> 16:49.180\n I say all this because mostly I'm extremely self critical\n\n16:49.180 --> 16:50.420\n in everything I do.\n\n16:50.420 --> 16:54.180\n And so, and I kind of enjoy it.\n\n16:54.180 --> 16:57.140\n I think it's a nice little engine that it makes it fun.\n\n16:57.140 --> 16:57.980\n It makes life fun,\n\n16:57.980 --> 17:01.980\n because it's like if you hate everything you do,\n\n17:01.980 --> 17:04.180\n like you've done in the past,\n\n17:04.180 --> 17:06.500\n that gives you like, all right, we can do better.\n\n17:06.500 --> 17:09.500\n Yes, but that's the key is making yourself critical.\n\n17:09.500 --> 17:10.620\n Always trying to get better.\n\n17:10.620 --> 17:11.940\n I could change this, I could tweak this,\n\n17:11.940 --> 17:13.280\n I could improve this.\n\n17:13.280 --> 17:15.500\n When you just go, I hate that I do this, I suck,\n\n17:15.500 --> 17:16.340\n you just shut down.\n\n17:16.340 --> 17:19.540\n So that's the key is always being productive\n\n17:19.540 --> 17:21.380\n with the criticism.\n\n17:21.380 --> 17:22.700\n Yeah, and the basics of life,\n\n17:22.700 --> 17:24.740\n I'm just like grateful for it, to be alive.\n\n17:24.740 --> 17:27.660\n That's nice to be coupled that with self criticism.\n\n17:27.660 --> 17:30.460\n Two legs, again, the hairline, the hog,\n\n17:30.460 --> 17:32.980\n the muscles, the world.\n\n17:32.980 --> 17:34.220\n You got a good brain on you.\n\n17:34.220 --> 17:35.740\n I mean, you're lucky.\n\n17:35.740 --> 17:37.340\n You're in the top,\n\n17:37.340 --> 17:39.640\n most people are fat as shit at Burger King right now,\n\n17:39.640 --> 17:40.980\n hitting their kids.\n\n17:40.980 --> 17:41.820\n Yeah.\n\n17:41.820 --> 17:43.860\n You're in a Ramada hotel,\n\n17:43.860 --> 17:47.660\n sitting with a low level comedian.\n\n17:47.660 --> 17:49.620\n For the record, I ate McDonald's last night.\n\n17:49.620 --> 17:52.180\n Oh, all right, well, you're human.\n\n17:52.180 --> 17:54.580\n Well, just so you know, this is not me defending,\n\n17:54.580 --> 17:56.020\n I'm not sponsored by McDonald's,\n\n17:56.020 --> 17:57.620\n but I mostly eat meat,\n\n17:57.620 --> 18:01.340\n and there's nothing wrong with the beef they have.\n\n18:01.340 --> 18:04.020\n It's actually one of the easiest ways late at night.\n\n18:04.020 --> 18:05.420\n I think it's worse.\n\n18:05.420 --> 18:07.020\n I don't know if it's actually cow.\n\n18:07.020 --> 18:07.980\n It's actually rats.\n\n18:07.980 --> 18:09.140\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n18:09.140 --> 18:10.500\n But hey, it's just meat.\n\n18:10.500 --> 18:11.920\n I'm a meat guy myself.\n\n18:12.940 --> 18:14.820\n They say in 20 years, we're gonna look back\n\n18:14.820 --> 18:16.540\n and go, can you believe people ate meat?\n\n18:16.540 --> 18:18.540\n It's gonna look like somebody like slavery.\n\n18:18.540 --> 18:20.340\n Yeah, there's some ethical,\n\n18:20.340 --> 18:22.640\n difficult things with factory farming.\n\n18:22.640 --> 18:26.140\n Yeah, so let's ride it out now while we still got it.\n\n18:26.140 --> 18:27.560\n And now it's on record.\n\n18:28.820 --> 18:31.420\n Tom Waits says something about New York.\n\n18:31.420 --> 18:32.300\n You like Tom Waits?\n\n18:32.300 --> 18:33.460\n I think he's underrated.\n\n18:33.460 --> 18:34.860\n I think he's got great,\n\n18:34.860 --> 18:38.020\n he's got a great, he's great at quips and quotes.\n\n18:38.020 --> 18:39.300\n Check him out on YouTube.\n\n18:39.300 --> 18:41.820\n He's got some montages and super cuts\n\n18:41.820 --> 18:43.460\n of him being hilarious.\n\n18:43.460 --> 18:44.620\n What does he say about,\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:49.100\n I'd rather have a bottle in front of me\n\n18:49.100 --> 18:50.420\n than a frontal lobotomy.\n\n18:50.420 --> 18:51.420\n That was the one.\n\n18:51.420 --> 18:52.240\n That was the one that sold me.\n\n18:52.240 --> 18:53.540\n I was like, this guy's awesome.\n\n18:53.540 --> 18:54.860\n Yeah, but his music,\n\n18:54.860 --> 18:56.900\n cause he's just a genius musician.\n\n18:56.900 --> 18:57.740\n Yeah.\n\n18:57.740 --> 18:59.740\n Anyway, he was talking about New York.\n\n18:59.740 --> 19:01.940\n I was walking around, I'm in New York right now.\n\n19:01.940 --> 19:03.380\n We're in New York right now.\n\n19:03.380 --> 19:04.860\n It's still a magical city to me.\n\n19:04.860 --> 19:06.860\n A lot of people are quite cynical about it,\n\n19:06.860 --> 19:08.220\n about the state of things, but.\n\n19:08.220 --> 19:09.060\n Go again.\n\n19:09.060 --> 19:13.220\n Not like Michael Malice, like a lot of friends of mine,\n\n19:13.220 --> 19:15.880\n they're just a lot of folks in San Francisco and New York,\n\n19:15.880 --> 19:17.180\n there's something about the pandemic\n\n19:17.180 --> 19:19.540\n where people have become quite cynical\n\n19:19.540 --> 19:22.100\n about the place they are and they try to escape.\n\n19:22.100 --> 19:22.940\n It's interesting.\n\n19:22.940 --> 19:24.580\n I mean, they're asking some difficult questions\n\n19:24.580 --> 19:26.020\n about what they are in life.\n\n19:26.020 --> 19:29.100\n They're having like a self imposed midlife crisis.\n\n19:29.100 --> 19:32.260\n It's good, I think, for everybody to go through this process.\n\n19:32.260 --> 19:35.540\n But I think, I hope New York reemerges.\n\n19:35.540 --> 19:36.380\n It will.\n\n19:36.380 --> 19:37.900\n As the flourishing place for the weirdos.\n\n19:37.900 --> 19:39.700\n Anyway, Tom Waits said,\n\n19:39.700 --> 19:44.700\n New York, of course, is to be in endless surreal situations\n\n19:45.420 --> 19:48.460\n where a $50,000 gun metal Mercedes\n\n19:48.460 --> 19:50.500\n pulls up in a puddle of blood\n\n19:50.500 --> 19:54.540\n and out steps a 25 carat blonde with a $2 wristwatch.\n\n19:54.540 --> 19:55.380\n Woo!\n\n19:55.380 --> 19:56.780\n And he goes, he keeps going on.\n\n19:56.780 --> 19:58.700\n So like, it's like a.\n\n19:58.700 --> 20:00.340\n That's like bars, he's like a rapper.\n\n20:00.340 --> 20:02.660\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's good.\n\n20:02.660 --> 20:06.260\n But basically, just the absurdity of it all.\n\n20:06.260 --> 20:10.740\n Lots of money, lots of weirdos, degenerates,\n\n20:10.740 --> 20:14.160\n and dreamers, and the whole mix of it.\n\n20:14.160 --> 20:18.020\n Do you think that's an accurate description\n\n20:18.020 --> 20:19.620\n of what New York is today?\n\n20:19.620 --> 20:22.220\n Like, is there still place for the weirdos\n\n20:22.220 --> 20:24.940\n and just the interesting artists,\n\n20:24.940 --> 20:29.760\n the edgy, the comedians, the creators,\n\n20:29.760 --> 20:34.760\n the entrepreneurs, as opposed to like Wall Street,\n\n20:35.180 --> 20:38.500\n as opposed to like rich folk,\n\n20:38.500 --> 20:40.900\n and then like hopeless folk?\n\n20:40.900 --> 20:42.660\n Yeah, I think it's definitely changed a lot.\n\n20:42.660 --> 20:46.140\n There's a tiny corner for us weirdo artists.\n\n20:46.140 --> 20:48.260\n New York used to be where you went to make it\n\n20:48.260 --> 20:51.060\n as a painter or whatever, a comedian or a singer.\n\n20:51.060 --> 20:53.180\n And there were all these dives and shit boxes\n\n20:53.180 --> 20:54.680\n and all these places you could go.\n\n20:54.680 --> 20:57.020\n And now it's more Pink Berries\n\n20:57.020 --> 20:59.500\n and Subway Sandwiches and Chase Banks.\n\n20:59.500 --> 21:03.900\n So it's definitely lost a lot of its creative edge.\n\n21:03.900 --> 21:05.540\n It's just money, money keeps coming in.\n\n21:05.540 --> 21:07.780\n And now you see all these comedians move to Nashville,\n\n21:07.780 --> 21:09.720\n Austin, Denver, whatever.\n\n21:09.720 --> 21:13.660\n So it doesn't have the power it used to have\n\n21:13.660 --> 21:16.000\n of like, you gotta be here if you wanna make it.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:17.940\n That's definitely gone.\n\n21:17.940 --> 21:20.100\n So that hurt the city a lot.\n\n21:20.100 --> 21:22.900\n The city is way more soulless.\n\n21:22.900 --> 21:24.620\n When I moved here in 07,\n\n21:24.620 --> 21:26.180\n I mean, not only did I get mugged three times\n\n21:26.180 --> 21:31.140\n in the first year, but it was a hub of like,\n\n21:31.140 --> 21:33.140\n it felt like things were happening here.\n\n21:33.140 --> 21:34.900\n It was an energy, it was electricity.\n\n21:34.900 --> 21:35.940\n And we still have the electricity,\n\n21:35.940 --> 21:38.120\n but it's also maybe just cause there's Times Square,\n\n21:38.120 --> 21:41.120\n there's Soho, there's Wall Street.\n\n21:41.120 --> 21:44.120\n So we got the staples, but there is a little bit of that.\n\n21:44.120 --> 21:45.300\n It's almost like a marriage.\n\n21:45.300 --> 21:46.420\n Like, yeah, we're in love,\n\n21:46.420 --> 21:49.500\n but it's not as passionate as it once was.\n\n21:49.500 --> 21:51.700\n That's how I would equate New York.\n\n21:51.700 --> 21:52.600\n What gives you hope?\n\n21:52.600 --> 21:54.660\n You're pretty hopeful about it though.\n\n21:54.660 --> 21:57.100\n I'm hopeful just cause I know it's magical\n\n21:57.100 --> 21:59.500\n and I think it has to be.\n\n21:59.500 --> 22:01.060\n I mean, it's the epicenter of America.\n\n22:01.060 --> 22:02.980\n Like this is where the immigrants came\n\n22:02.980 --> 22:05.380\n and this is where the stock market is\n\n22:05.380 --> 22:08.260\n and the entertainment industry, a lot of it is here.\n\n22:08.260 --> 22:12.100\n So I think it's gonna happen,\n\n22:12.100 --> 22:14.620\n but something like the bottom has to fall out\n\n22:14.620 --> 22:16.640\n and then people have to move back here and all that.\n\n22:16.640 --> 22:19.580\n So something, the corporations are kind of fucking us.\n\n22:19.580 --> 22:20.820\n They're just buying everything.\n\n22:20.820 --> 22:22.060\n Well, that's true for everything.\n\n22:22.060 --> 22:23.220\n That's true for everything.\n\n22:23.220 --> 22:24.980\n This is true for Austin probably as well.\n\n22:24.980 --> 22:27.140\n People are just buying out land and all that kind of stuff.\n\n22:27.140 --> 22:28.860\n You always hear a Hemingway and Dali\n\n22:28.860 --> 22:32.340\n and all these guys went to Paris in the 20s\n\n22:32.340 --> 22:34.020\n or whatever that was.\n\n22:34.020 --> 22:35.100\n I get it now.\n\n22:35.100 --> 22:36.780\n I used to be like, why do these guys go to Paris?\n\n22:36.780 --> 22:38.200\n Why do these artists?\n\n22:38.200 --> 22:39.040\n And now I get it.\n\n22:39.040 --> 22:41.180\n Cause it's like, it's freer there.\n\n22:41.180 --> 22:43.580\n That's why Austin became like that Paris\n\n22:43.580 --> 22:44.980\n where everybody's like, I gotta get out of LA.\n\n22:44.980 --> 22:46.540\n I'm going there.\n\n22:46.540 --> 22:50.620\n And maybe, but we came back from that.\n\n22:50.620 --> 22:53.520\n 70s were wild and 90s were cool.\n\n22:53.520 --> 22:54.740\n So maybe it'll come back.\n\n22:54.740 --> 22:55.860\n Might just take a decade.\n\n22:55.860 --> 22:57.700\n Well, there's always, that's how stories are told.\n\n22:57.700 --> 23:02.700\n There's always pockets of like Paris within New York.\n\n23:02.820 --> 23:03.840\n True, true.\n\n23:03.840 --> 23:07.980\n There's just an opportunity to let your weird flourish\n\n23:07.980 --> 23:09.620\n is there in New York, I'm sure.\n\n23:09.620 --> 23:10.700\n There, I mean.\n\n23:12.700 --> 23:13.520\n It's there.\n\n23:13.520 --> 23:14.360\n You gotta find it.\n\n23:14.360 --> 23:16.060\n Before it was front and center.\n\n23:16.060 --> 23:18.160\n What's your favorite thing about New York?\n\n23:18.160 --> 23:22.060\n Like what kind of things just like.\n\n23:22.060 --> 23:23.220\n I mean, how long is this pod?\n\n23:23.220 --> 23:24.040\n I could go on.\n\n23:24.040 --> 23:27.460\n It's just, it's too much to put into one hour.\n\n23:27.460 --> 23:31.300\n We've got other questions, but I love that one neighborhood\n\n23:31.300 --> 23:33.220\n is wildly different than the next.\n\n23:33.220 --> 23:35.400\n I'm in Little Italy and then you take four steps.\n\n23:35.400 --> 23:36.500\n Now I'm in Chinatown.\n\n23:36.500 --> 23:39.560\n I mean, and then the history there and then the stories\n\n23:39.560 --> 23:42.420\n and the food and the culture and all that.\n\n23:42.420 --> 23:44.140\n And then you go 10 feet over here.\n\n23:44.140 --> 23:45.160\n Now you're in Brooklyn.\n\n23:45.160 --> 23:47.080\n And this is insane as a whole nother world.\n\n23:47.080 --> 23:49.940\n And it's almost like a little America in one,\n\n23:51.740 --> 23:54.100\n you know, city and it's great.\n\n23:54.100 --> 23:56.700\n And just the fact that they pulled it off\n\n23:56.700 --> 23:59.380\n like Fifth Avenue goes way up.\n\n23:59.380 --> 24:00.740\n And you're like, there's a billionaire's house\n\n24:00.740 --> 24:01.780\n next to a hobo.\n\n24:01.780 --> 24:04.580\n And then this is a black guy who's fighting with a Cuban guy\n\n24:04.580 --> 24:07.340\n and an Asian guy is trying to get in the middle of them.\n\n24:07.340 --> 24:09.380\n And the cabbie's from the Middle East.\n\n24:09.380 --> 24:12.000\n And there's so many beautiful women here.\n\n24:12.000 --> 24:13.620\n And there's so many brilliant minds here.\n\n24:13.620 --> 24:15.020\n And the pace is great.\n\n24:15.020 --> 24:16.140\n It keeps people moving.\n\n24:16.140 --> 24:18.720\n I mean, it just, you can't beat it.\n\n24:18.720 --> 24:20.580\n And the city will fuck you in the ass too.\n\n24:20.580 --> 24:21.420\n Don't get me wrong.\n\n24:21.420 --> 24:23.900\n You landed JFK and you're like, oh God, I got mugged.\n\n24:23.900 --> 24:27.460\n My Uber driver called me a homo.\n\n24:27.460 --> 24:29.380\n I stepped in human shit.\n\n24:29.380 --> 24:30.600\n Where the fuck am I?\n\n24:31.800 --> 24:33.460\n So yeah, it's bad news.\n\n24:33.460 --> 24:35.900\n But that bad news, it's almost like the bullying.\n\n24:35.900 --> 24:38.380\n It kills you in a weird way, but it makes you stronger.\n\n24:38.380 --> 24:40.540\n And you build more layers and layers and layers.\n\n24:40.540 --> 24:41.740\n That's why some new guys,\n\n24:41.740 --> 24:44.140\n some hayseed from Milwaukee shows up.\n\n24:44.140 --> 24:46.020\n You've been here 10 years and you go,\n\n24:46.020 --> 24:47.420\n let me help you out.\n\n24:47.420 --> 24:50.220\n Cause you gotta adjust.\n\n24:50.220 --> 24:52.820\n You're gonna get your ass kicked for like six months.\n\n24:52.820 --> 24:54.100\n But I know the ropes a little,\n\n24:54.100 --> 24:55.940\n and I think you need a little of that.\n\n24:55.940 --> 25:00.020\n If the treadmill's not on, you're not gonna run.\n\n25:00.020 --> 25:01.320\n New York, the treadmill's on.\n\n25:01.320 --> 25:03.980\n So it just makes you run and it makes you better.\n\n25:03.980 --> 25:04.820\n And look, it wears on you.\n\n25:04.820 --> 25:06.260\n You probably lose 10 years of your life\n\n25:06.260 --> 25:09.740\n living in New York versus Indianapolis,\n\n25:09.740 --> 25:12.580\n but it's a better life.\n\n25:12.580 --> 25:13.980\n Have you seen 25th Hour?\n\n25:13.980 --> 25:15.940\n Yeah, it's been a while.\n\n25:15.940 --> 25:17.460\n Spike Lee joint.\n\n25:17.460 --> 25:18.700\n Yeah, Spike Lee joint.\n\n25:18.700 --> 25:23.340\n I mean, at Norton, there's a whole monologue there\n\n25:23.340 --> 25:24.180\n about New York.\n\n25:24.180 --> 25:25.180\n Oh, that's right.\n\n25:25.180 --> 25:30.100\n They're talking about just, he has like a mix.\n\n25:30.100 --> 25:31.940\n There's like melancholy music, I think,\n\n25:31.940 --> 25:34.100\n or just a melancholy feel to the whole thing.\n\n25:34.100 --> 25:37.100\n But there's an anger and a disgust with the city.\n\n25:37.100 --> 25:38.780\n But through the anger and the disgust\n\n25:38.780 --> 25:40.940\n comes out like a love for the city.\n\n25:40.940 --> 25:43.020\n Same with, was Taxi Driver in New York?\n\n25:43.020 --> 25:45.260\n Oh yeah, it's going crazy.\n\n25:45.260 --> 25:48.620\n Yeah, so like that, there's something about, what is that?\n\n25:48.620 --> 25:53.620\n What is that grit of the city that like pushes you down?\n\n25:56.180 --> 25:57.280\n Well, that's the beauty of this city\n\n25:57.280 --> 25:59.780\n is it's this tribal human nature,\n\n25:59.780 --> 26:04.180\n like the sex shops and fistfights and racism\n\n26:04.180 --> 26:05.500\n and all this tension,\n\n26:05.500 --> 26:08.660\n but yet it's the epicenter of technology and finance\n\n26:08.660 --> 26:10.540\n and sophistication on Fifth Avenue.\n\n26:10.540 --> 26:13.820\n So you get that juxtaposition.\n\n26:13.820 --> 26:14.700\n It's kind of like in Boston.\n\n26:14.700 --> 26:16.900\n You go to Boston, they got MIT, they got Harvard,\n\n26:16.900 --> 26:18.300\n they got all this shit.\n\n26:18.300 --> 26:21.780\n And then they got the fishermen, the blue collar douchebags,\n\n26:21.780 --> 26:23.860\n the Irish guys, the immigrants,\n\n26:23.860 --> 26:26.780\n and you get that mix of like insanely smart\n\n26:26.780 --> 26:30.180\n with wicked pisser and these two worlds.\n\n26:30.180 --> 26:31.420\n And that's a good thing.\n\n26:31.420 --> 26:33.760\n It's like when a black guy fucks an Asian lady,\n\n26:33.760 --> 26:35.420\n that's a good looking kid.\n\n26:35.420 --> 26:36.860\n You get a mix.\n\n26:36.860 --> 26:39.460\n We're mixing two totally different things\n\n26:39.460 --> 26:40.780\n are coming together and it makes it,\n\n26:40.780 --> 26:43.140\n it's like peanut butter and chocolate.\n\n26:43.140 --> 26:45.540\n Peanut butter and chocolate, I've never tried that.\n\n26:45.540 --> 26:46.380\n What?\n\n26:46.380 --> 26:47.220\n Peanut butter, maybe I have.\n\n26:47.220 --> 26:48.780\n You're talking about Reese's, man.\n\n26:48.780 --> 26:50.740\n Like Reese's, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n26:50.740 --> 26:52.180\n Oh, it's the best candy.\n\n26:52.180 --> 26:55.660\n Yeah, without the fakeness of LA,\n\n26:55.660 --> 27:00.460\n without the kind of, with the facade.\n\n27:00.460 --> 27:01.760\n Yeah, LA's tough.\n\n27:03.040 --> 27:05.720\n What's the difference between LA comedy\n\n27:05.720 --> 27:07.060\n and New York comedy to you?\n\n27:08.260 --> 27:10.580\n I think one place you kind of go to make it\n\n27:10.580 --> 27:13.460\n and be discovered and be loved,\n\n27:13.460 --> 27:16.180\n and one place you go, you can get all that in New York too,\n\n27:16.180 --> 27:19.060\n but I think in New York, it's more of a school,\n\n27:19.060 --> 27:21.060\n a bootcamp of comedy.\n\n27:21.060 --> 27:22.740\n Let's make great comedy.\n\n27:22.740 --> 27:23.980\n Let's make original comedy.\n\n27:23.980 --> 27:26.260\n Let's watch the other guys and gals\n\n27:26.260 --> 27:29.380\n who are at the show at the clubs and learn from them\n\n27:29.380 --> 27:33.200\n and try to hang out with them and absorb some of them.\n\n27:33.200 --> 27:36.060\n And in LA, it's like, when am I on?\n\n27:36.060 --> 27:38.080\n I'm next, get out of my way.\n\n27:38.080 --> 27:39.900\n I'm the star here.\n\n27:39.900 --> 27:41.320\n I'm a bigger star than you.\n\n27:41.320 --> 27:42.620\n Oh, this guy's actually a big star.\n\n27:42.620 --> 27:44.680\n I got to outwork, you know, it's just a lot of that\n\n27:44.680 --> 27:46.460\n instead of like, damn, that was funny.\n\n27:46.460 --> 27:47.860\n I got to be that funny.\n\n27:47.860 --> 27:48.980\n Damn, I wish I had a joke.\n\n27:48.980 --> 27:51.020\n And look, I don't want to speak for LA comics\n\n27:51.020 --> 27:54.340\n because there's, you know, Bill Burr, Anthony Jeslenek,\n\n27:54.340 --> 27:56.840\n brilliant LA comic, but they all cut their teeth\n\n27:56.840 --> 27:58.520\n in New York, just saying.\n\n27:58.520 --> 28:00.220\n Then they moved to LA.\n\n28:00.220 --> 28:01.060\n That's a good point.\n\n28:01.060 --> 28:03.360\n You know, Ali Wong, all these people, killer comics,\n\n28:03.360 --> 28:07.220\n but New York, started in New York, moved to New York.\n\n28:07.220 --> 28:09.300\n There is something about comics that stay in New York\n\n28:09.300 --> 28:11.060\n for a long time though, like Dave Attell.\n\n28:11.060 --> 28:12.580\n Ah, you know about Dave?\n\n28:12.580 --> 28:14.340\n Yeah, yeah, he wants to do this podcast.\n\n28:14.340 --> 28:15.180\n He does?\n\n28:15.180 --> 28:16.860\n Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Dave Attell.\n\n28:16.860 --> 28:21.100\n But it's like, he almost like he doesn't want to make it.\n\n28:21.100 --> 28:21.940\n I don't know.\n\n28:21.940 --> 28:23.780\n I mean, you probably know him, but like,\n\n28:23.780 --> 28:27.900\n it feels like you just, maybe it's romanticizing it,\n\n28:27.900 --> 28:31.180\n but you're like, you almost just love the art of comedy,\n\n28:31.180 --> 28:34.060\n like becoming funnier, crafting the jokes,\n\n28:34.060 --> 28:35.700\n becoming funnier than the other comics,\n\n28:35.700 --> 28:37.580\n like competing with each other kind of thing,\n\n28:37.580 --> 28:41.180\n not over like money or fame or any of that,\n\n28:41.180 --> 28:43.180\n just purely the comedy of it.\n\n28:43.180 --> 28:44.260\n Totally, that's Dave.\n\n28:44.260 --> 28:45.100\n That's him in a nutshell.\n\n28:45.100 --> 28:46.780\n He's like that guy in the movies in the 80s,\n\n28:46.780 --> 28:48.100\n action movies, where they're like,\n\n28:48.100 --> 28:50.620\n they go up to a creek in Montana,\n\n28:50.620 --> 28:51.820\n and some guy's living in a cabin,\n\n28:51.820 --> 28:54.320\n and he's sharpening a stick, and they go,\n\n28:54.320 --> 28:56.160\n the Russians are coming, they're invading.\n\n28:56.160 --> 28:57.860\n We need you, you're the best commando.\n\n28:57.860 --> 28:59.580\n And he's like, I gave that up, man.\n\n28:59.580 --> 29:00.820\n I'm done with that lifestyle.\n\n29:00.820 --> 29:02.620\n They're like, but you're the best, we need you.\n\n29:02.620 --> 29:04.620\n And he has to suit up eventually.\n\n29:04.620 --> 29:06.180\n You know, he looks at a picture of his dead wife,\n\n29:06.180 --> 29:07.460\n and he goes, fuck it, I'm going.\n\n29:07.460 --> 29:09.420\n And then they, you know, fight the Ruskies.\n\n29:09.420 --> 29:11.220\n But he's that guy.\n\n29:11.220 --> 29:12.740\n He just is gifted.\n\n29:12.740 --> 29:16.820\n He's like got a gift from Allah, and he's the best.\n\n29:16.820 --> 29:18.660\n Yeah, a lot of comics give him props.\n\n29:18.660 --> 29:20.140\n That's always surprising to me.\n\n29:20.140 --> 29:21.660\n Because it's surprising to me\n\n29:21.660 --> 29:25.380\n because he hasn't really made it, like big.\n\n29:25.380 --> 29:26.300\n Well, he did.\n\n29:26.300 --> 29:27.380\n In the 90s, he was huge.\n\n29:27.380 --> 29:28.580\n He had his own TV show.\n\n29:28.580 --> 29:30.980\n Yeah, yeah, that show was awesome.\n\n29:30.980 --> 29:34.260\n But I mean, like as big as I think he deserves to be.\n\n29:34.260 --> 29:35.100\n Well, that's art.\n\n29:35.100 --> 29:37.900\n The mainstream shit is always the worst.\n\n29:37.900 --> 29:40.500\n It's like McDonald's versus some hole in the wall.\n\n29:40.500 --> 29:43.860\n I know I'm shitting on McDonald's again, but it's good.\n\n29:43.860 --> 29:46.140\n And you know, certain comics we could name are good,\n\n29:46.140 --> 29:51.140\n but the delicacy is going to be less talked about\n\n29:51.980 --> 29:56.980\n and less household namey than the mainstream hacky shit.\n\n29:58.100 --> 29:59.740\n Yeah, it's funny because he hasn't,\n\n29:59.740 --> 30:04.100\n I think it was on Joe Rogan's show once, maybe.\n\n30:04.100 --> 30:04.940\n Yeah, once or twice.\n\n30:04.940 --> 30:07.700\n And he was with somebody else.\n\n30:07.700 --> 30:08.540\n Jeff Ross?\n\n30:08.540 --> 30:10.380\n Yeah, he might have known Jeff Ross.\n\n30:10.380 --> 30:12.260\n Oh yeah, because they did that like two mics thing,\n\n30:12.260 --> 30:13.100\n whatever.\n\n30:13.100 --> 30:13.920\n Oh, big mics, yeah.\n\n30:13.920 --> 30:15.440\n Yeah.\n\n30:15.440 --> 30:16.700\n But he's the quickest guy.\n\n30:16.700 --> 30:17.820\n There's no one funnier.\n\n30:17.820 --> 30:18.940\n Yeah.\n\n30:18.940 --> 30:22.300\n Yeah, him and you, you're super quick.\n\n30:22.300 --> 30:24.740\n Your appearance on, recent appearance on Rogan's hilarious.\n\n30:24.740 --> 30:25.580\n Oh, thanks.\n\n30:25.580 --> 30:27.060\n Just so fast.\n\n30:27.060 --> 30:29.560\n You're on with Ari and...\n\n30:29.560 --> 30:30.400\n Shane Gillis.\n\n30:30.400 --> 30:31.220\n Shane Gillis.\n\n30:31.220 --> 30:32.060\n Yeah, that was fun.\n\n30:32.060 --> 30:33.580\n We're going back in January.\n\n30:33.580 --> 30:35.620\n I don't know when this comes out.\n\n30:35.620 --> 30:36.920\n This has never come out.\n\n30:38.060 --> 30:38.980\n Neither will you.\n\n30:40.380 --> 30:41.340\n We're having fun.\n\n30:41.340 --> 30:42.180\n Yep.\n\n30:42.180 --> 30:46.320\n All right, so what does it feel like to bomb\n\n30:46.320 --> 30:49.140\n in standup comedy, like to fail?\n\n30:49.140 --> 30:51.020\n Maybe the psychology of it first,\n\n30:51.020 --> 30:53.340\n like just take me through it.\n\n30:53.340 --> 30:57.220\n Cause we're talking about being outnumbered in a fight,\n\n30:57.220 --> 30:58.180\n just being beat up.\n\n30:58.180 --> 30:59.020\n Very similar.\n\n31:00.260 --> 31:02.740\n By the way, this is like a no eye contact off.\n\n31:02.740 --> 31:05.540\n Yeah, we're both uncomfortable with it.\n\n31:05.540 --> 31:06.740\n Yeah, it's great.\n\n31:06.740 --> 31:10.180\n It's kind of nice to be with my people, but yeah.\n\n31:10.180 --> 31:12.420\n Do you need a sheet of paper to look at it?\n\n31:12.420 --> 31:15.980\n I'm going, I got a good sweet spot right there.\n\n31:15.980 --> 31:18.860\n Yeah, it's a nightmare, but it's part of it.\n\n31:21.740 --> 31:24.280\n It's the validation too is the worst part.\n\n31:24.280 --> 31:27.200\n Cause you know, whenever you do comedy and kill,\n\n31:27.200 --> 31:28.200\n you can be a great comic,\n\n31:28.200 --> 31:29.940\n but even David Tell, these brilliant guys,\n\n31:29.940 --> 31:30.780\n they feel like they're getting,\n\n31:30.780 --> 31:32.180\n you feel like you're getting away with something.\n\n31:32.180 --> 31:33.140\n I don't have a day job.\n\n31:33.140 --> 31:34.300\n I'm telling jokes for a living.\n\n31:34.300 --> 31:35.540\n I'm talking about my dick up here\n\n31:35.540 --> 31:36.580\n and they're fucking loving me.\n\n31:36.580 --> 31:38.460\n And they call me a genius and all this.\n\n31:38.460 --> 31:40.640\n I'm talking about my sack, you know?\n\n31:40.640 --> 31:42.020\n And it's great.\n\n31:42.020 --> 31:43.340\n It makes people happy and it's funny,\n\n31:43.340 --> 31:46.780\n but that bombing, when you bomb,\n\n31:46.780 --> 31:48.820\n your first thought is like, yeah, you're right.\n\n31:48.820 --> 31:50.820\n At first you're like, fuck you guys.\n\n31:50.820 --> 31:51.780\n What, you don't like this shit?\n\n31:51.780 --> 31:53.020\n And then you just start going in.\n\n31:53.020 --> 31:54.940\n You're like, man, maybe it isn't that good.\n\n31:54.940 --> 31:55.780\n Maybe they're right.\n\n31:55.780 --> 31:56.700\n I do suck.\n\n31:56.700 --> 31:57.860\n I knew I sucked.\n\n31:57.860 --> 32:00.100\n I should become a mailman, you know?\n\n32:00.100 --> 32:03.580\n And it stinks and you feel alone.\n\n32:03.580 --> 32:06.180\n And you feel like you wasted their time.\n\n32:06.180 --> 32:07.460\n And then you're like, what was I thinking?\n\n32:07.460 --> 32:08.380\n I could be a comedian.\n\n32:08.380 --> 32:09.460\n What the fuck, who am I?\n\n32:09.460 --> 32:11.740\n You know, Eddie Murphy, what am I doing here?\n\n32:11.740 --> 32:16.340\n So it's a lot of just spiraling out of horrible thoughts.\n\n32:16.340 --> 32:18.580\n But I also love that it hurts so bad.\n\n32:18.580 --> 32:23.260\n Bombing fucking hurts because now everybody doesn't do it.\n\n32:23.260 --> 32:25.220\n I think a lot more people could do comedy probably\n\n32:25.220 --> 32:26.460\n and figure it out.\n\n32:26.460 --> 32:28.600\n But the bombing is so brutal\n\n32:28.600 --> 32:31.460\n that it keeps, one time I went to Minneapolis.\n\n32:31.460 --> 32:32.580\n I was like, this is a great city.\n\n32:32.580 --> 32:33.820\n I mean, it's a sun is shining.\n\n32:33.820 --> 32:35.460\n Why isn't this city like packed?\n\n32:35.460 --> 32:36.920\n And they're like, cause the winters are so bad\n\n32:36.920 --> 32:38.680\n and we love it because it keeps everybody out.\n\n32:38.680 --> 32:39.820\n And I feel like the same about comedy.\n\n32:39.820 --> 32:41.820\n The bombs are so brutal.\n\n32:41.820 --> 32:43.320\n I've had bombs where I'm in bed.\n\n32:43.320 --> 32:45.760\n I'm just staring at the ceiling like, what the fuck was that?\n\n32:45.760 --> 32:47.400\n Like you have PTSD.\n\n32:47.400 --> 32:49.960\n I bombed at an arena once, 20,000 people.\n\n32:49.960 --> 32:52.460\n I did 30 minutes to silence.\n\n32:52.460 --> 32:53.300\n I guess.\n\n32:53.300 --> 32:54.780\n So it's not just like one joke fails.\n\n32:54.780 --> 32:58.580\n It's like they start piling on like it's irrecoverable.\n\n32:58.580 --> 32:59.420\n Yes.\n\n32:59.420 --> 33:00.980\n And one joke failing is very common.\n\n33:00.980 --> 33:03.860\n Like a lot of audience don't even notice like that bomb.\n\n33:03.860 --> 33:05.540\n Cause you get, you know, you've got so many jokes in a row.\n\n33:05.540 --> 33:07.140\n You can sandwich a good one, then a bad one,\n\n33:07.140 --> 33:08.140\n then a good one.\n\n33:08.140 --> 33:10.460\n But when you bomb, it's almost like they chose,\n\n33:10.460 --> 33:12.160\n we don't like you.\n\n33:12.160 --> 33:14.500\n Nothing you say will redeem yourself.\n\n33:14.500 --> 33:16.780\n And it's hard to get out of.\n\n33:16.780 --> 33:18.300\n It's like being pulled down by your hair.\n\n33:18.300 --> 33:19.420\n You can't get back.\n\n33:19.420 --> 33:21.940\n I can't win this fight no matter what.\n\n33:21.940 --> 33:24.620\n Can you like get them back by acknowledging\n\n33:24.620 --> 33:27.060\n like the elephant in the room that like.\n\n33:27.060 --> 33:28.540\n That helps, but they're still gonna go,\n\n33:28.540 --> 33:31.380\n that was funny when he made fun of it, but he sucks.\n\n33:31.380 --> 33:32.220\n He still sucks.\n\n33:32.220 --> 33:33.420\n He still sucks.\n\n33:33.420 --> 33:34.360\n That's the worst part.\n\n33:34.360 --> 33:36.140\n You're going, no, this is good.\n\n33:36.140 --> 33:37.220\n You guys just don't like me.\n\n33:37.220 --> 33:39.540\n Just cause you don't like me doesn't mean I'm bad.\n\n33:39.540 --> 33:41.740\n Yeah, I like going to open mics a lot.\n\n33:41.740 --> 33:45.540\n Just listening because first of all,\n\n33:45.540 --> 33:47.180\n I think the audience in open mic,\n\n33:47.180 --> 33:49.460\n at least the ones I've been to,\n\n33:49.460 --> 33:51.900\n is mostly I guess other comedians\n\n33:51.900 --> 33:53.540\n or like at least people who don't seem\n\n33:53.540 --> 33:55.300\n to want to laugh at anything.\n\n33:55.300 --> 33:58.700\n And so I just love it because it's human nature\n\n33:58.700 --> 34:00.540\n and perseverance that is best.\n\n34:00.540 --> 34:02.820\n That here's comedians, like clearly,\n\n34:03.660 --> 34:04.860\n this is mostly in Austin.\n\n34:04.860 --> 34:06.140\n They have a dream.\n\n34:06.140 --> 34:07.820\n Like why would you get up there?\n\n34:07.820 --> 34:12.020\n Right, maybe some weird, you know,\n\n34:12.020 --> 34:13.900\n New Year's resolution bullshit,\n\n34:13.900 --> 34:16.300\n but for the most part, it's people who want to be comedians.\n\n34:16.300 --> 34:18.580\n Like a lot of the open micers are people\n\n34:18.580 --> 34:21.180\n who clearly have done this for quite a long time already.\n\n34:21.180 --> 34:24.500\n Like at least a year or two, maybe five years.\n\n34:24.500 --> 34:28.080\n And they're often not very funny.\n\n34:29.160 --> 34:34.160\n And just bombing in front of an audience of like 20\n\n34:36.700 --> 34:39.120\n where they're just sitting there,\n\n34:39.120 --> 34:42.460\n like almost like mocking them with their eyes\n\n34:42.460 --> 34:45.960\n or maybe, and I don't know, and they still push through.\n\n34:45.960 --> 34:49.380\n They still like, as if they're doing an arena\n\n34:49.380 --> 34:50.700\n and everybody's laughing.\n\n34:52.020 --> 34:54.260\n They still got that energy trying.\n\n34:54.260 --> 34:58.160\n Almost like to an audience that doesn't exist.\n\n34:58.160 --> 35:00.000\n Like an audience of their dreams.\n\n35:00.000 --> 35:01.900\n Cause I guess that you have to do that\n\n35:01.900 --> 35:03.740\n to keep the energy of the act going.\n\n35:03.740 --> 35:07.040\n And it's just so beautiful to watch them try it.\n\n35:08.300 --> 35:11.380\n And also what happens, open mic,\n\n35:11.380 --> 35:13.840\n I don't know, five minutes, whatever they do,\n\n35:13.840 --> 35:18.840\n they walk off and then walk back off stage.\n\n35:19.180 --> 35:21.860\n And like, you can't, who do they look at?\n\n35:21.860 --> 35:24.380\n Like what do you look at, do you make eye contact\n\n35:24.380 --> 35:25.700\n with people, do you?\n\n35:25.700 --> 35:27.340\n You look at your phone, you look at your feet,\n\n35:27.340 --> 35:28.660\n you just zone out.\n\n35:28.660 --> 35:32.380\n You kind of kind of go white, you know,\n\n35:32.380 --> 35:34.440\n you just hear white noise and go out.\n\n35:34.440 --> 35:37.260\n It's tough, but you got it.\n\n35:37.260 --> 35:40.400\n You need a little delusion to be a comedian.\n\n35:40.400 --> 35:42.340\n To get into it, it takes a little bit of delusion.\n\n35:42.340 --> 35:44.560\n Like you think you can do this, you know,\n\n35:44.560 --> 35:46.980\n you got 10 years ahead of you of hell\n\n35:46.980 --> 35:48.660\n and you're up for this.\n\n35:48.660 --> 35:50.980\n And you know, most comics, we see a horrible crowd\n\n35:50.980 --> 35:53.280\n and we see our friend bomb and we go,\n\n35:53.280 --> 35:55.040\n yeah, he's bombing, but I'll get him.\n\n35:55.040 --> 35:56.460\n I'll get him.\n\n35:56.460 --> 36:01.460\n And then you don't get him, but that's human nature too.\n\n36:02.100 --> 36:04.420\n It's like, they don't like him, but they'll like me.\n\n36:04.420 --> 36:07.180\n And you need a little of that to keep going as a comedian.\n\n36:07.180 --> 36:08.340\n But you don't want too much delusion\n\n36:08.340 --> 36:11.980\n because then you're a psycho, but you need a little.\n\n36:11.980 --> 36:13.980\n Well, the psycho could be good for a comedy.\n\n36:13.980 --> 36:15.740\n That's true too, love psychos.\n\n36:15.740 --> 36:18.740\n I mentioned to you offline that I talked to Elon\n\n36:18.740 --> 36:20.380\n and we talked about doing standup,\n\n36:20.380 --> 36:22.940\n but he's thinking maybe do a few minutes of standup.\n\n36:22.940 --> 36:25.640\n I was gonna say, if you need a coach, Elon, I gotcha.\n\n36:27.300 --> 36:28.660\n Well, maybe you should move to Austin\n\n36:28.660 --> 36:30.140\n to coach him full time.\n\n36:30.140 --> 36:32.140\n Ah, hopefully he can fly me in.\n\n36:32.140 --> 36:36.220\n So what advice would you give to somebody\n\n36:36.220 --> 36:39.200\n who wants to try to do five minutes,\n\n36:39.200 --> 36:44.200\n like the early steps of trying to go to an open mic\n\n36:44.980 --> 36:46.500\n and say something funny?\n\n36:46.500 --> 36:48.480\n Well, that's the irony of comedy is,\n\n36:48.480 --> 36:49.320\n I don't know if it's irony,\n\n36:49.320 --> 36:51.740\n but it's like the beginning is the hardest part.\n\n36:51.740 --> 36:53.380\n Usually the beginning is easy part.\n\n36:53.380 --> 36:55.300\n Hey, I'm playing this level of Mario.\n\n36:55.300 --> 36:57.820\n I start, I jump over one Koopa Troopa, whatever.\n\n36:57.820 --> 36:59.620\n And then the end is like, Jesus Christ,\n\n36:59.620 --> 37:01.180\n I got 30 guys coming at me.\n\n37:01.180 --> 37:02.140\n Comedy is the opposite.\n\n37:02.140 --> 37:04.980\n The beginning is like, it's a gauntlet.\n\n37:04.980 --> 37:06.220\n It's just obstacles.\n\n37:06.220 --> 37:07.940\n And it's like you said, open mics.\n\n37:07.940 --> 37:10.740\n I watched these famous comedians on Netflix and you go,\n\n37:10.740 --> 37:12.100\n this would all bomb at an open mic.\n\n37:12.100 --> 37:14.220\n They're killing in Radio City.\n\n37:14.220 --> 37:15.340\n This would bomb at an open mic.\n\n37:15.340 --> 37:16.300\n That's the weird part.\n\n37:16.300 --> 37:18.020\n So it's almost like you have to go through hell\n\n37:18.020 --> 37:21.340\n just to get to the promised land.\n\n37:21.340 --> 37:25.260\n And I would say, rehearse the shit out of it\n\n37:25.260 --> 37:26.820\n because you're gonna get frazzled up there.\n\n37:26.820 --> 37:28.540\n Everybody thinks, oh, this is good material.\n\n37:28.540 --> 37:31.260\n But you also forget about the other part of delivering it,\n\n37:31.260 --> 37:33.900\n having confidence, being likable,\n\n37:33.900 --> 37:35.980\n having timing, having a cadence,\n\n37:35.980 --> 37:37.100\n figuring out who you are,\n\n37:37.100 --> 37:39.300\n figuring out what the audience thinks you are\n\n37:39.300 --> 37:40.820\n or how they perceive you.\n\n37:40.820 --> 37:42.160\n Cause you can go up there and say all this,\n\n37:42.160 --> 37:44.380\n but they go, why is the guy, he's clearly gay.\n\n37:44.380 --> 37:46.100\n Why is he acting like he's not gay?\n\n37:46.100 --> 37:47.820\n That's all, now they're not listening to the joke.\n\n37:47.820 --> 37:50.380\n So like, you gotta know how you look.\n\n37:50.380 --> 37:53.200\n And it's just repetition, repetition.\n\n37:53.200 --> 37:54.980\n And bombing is not failure.\n\n37:54.980 --> 37:56.140\n That's what you gotta remember.\n\n37:56.140 --> 37:58.620\n I mean, look, if you do a killer hour\n\n37:58.620 --> 38:01.180\n and then you take it to Netflix and bomb, you fucked up.\n\n38:01.180 --> 38:03.080\n But bombing is not failure.\n\n38:03.080 --> 38:04.840\n It's just data.\n\n38:04.840 --> 38:07.700\n It's going, oh, okay, I gotta retool that.\n\n38:07.700 --> 38:08.540\n That didn't work.\n\n38:08.540 --> 38:09.820\n Something's wrong there.\n\n38:09.820 --> 38:11.180\n I missed a word there.\n\n38:11.180 --> 38:13.180\n So you gotta treat the act\n\n38:13.180 --> 38:18.180\n almost like ingredients in a cooking, in a dish.\n\n38:20.100 --> 38:22.100\n You know, like, oh, I put too many eggs in.\n\n38:22.100 --> 38:22.940\n Take an egg out.\n\n38:22.940 --> 38:24.360\n You gotta treat it like that.\n\n38:24.360 --> 38:26.540\n And look, when you pull a bad cake out of an oven,\n\n38:26.540 --> 38:27.860\n you go, I fucked up.\n\n38:27.860 --> 38:29.540\n But it doesn't hurt your feelings.\n\n38:29.540 --> 38:32.420\n But when you bomb and fuck up, it hurts your feelings.\n\n38:32.420 --> 38:33.620\n So you gotta factor that in too.\n\n38:33.620 --> 38:35.060\n Your feelings gonna be hurt\n\n38:35.060 --> 38:36.880\n and just almost be a robot\n\n38:36.880 --> 38:39.260\n and just keep going towards that open mic.\n\n38:39.260 --> 38:40.860\n You know how scary an open mic is?\n\n38:40.860 --> 38:43.500\n Bombing sucks, but bombing in front of other comedians\n\n38:43.500 --> 38:44.660\n is way worse.\n\n38:44.660 --> 38:47.100\n Cause they know what just happened\n\n38:47.100 --> 38:49.460\n and they could have saved you and they didn't.\n\n38:49.460 --> 38:51.180\n So it's way worse.\n\n38:51.180 --> 38:53.980\n And they're gonna be your quote unquote friends\n\n38:55.260 --> 38:56.140\n for this journey.\n\n38:56.140 --> 38:57.820\n Yeah, no, these are evil people.\n\n38:59.020 --> 39:02.820\n Twisted, fucked up, hurt people.\n\n39:02.820 --> 39:05.260\n Can you tell, like in those early days,\n\n39:05.260 --> 39:06.420\n let's just talk about that,\n\n39:06.420 --> 39:08.060\n like at the open mic level\n\n39:08.060 --> 39:11.180\n that a joke is gonna be good on paper.\n\n39:11.180 --> 39:12.660\n Like I'll give you my experience\n\n39:12.660 --> 39:16.560\n cause maybe you could be my coach\n\n39:16.560 --> 39:18.140\n in this particular moment.\n\n39:18.140 --> 39:18.980\n So.\n\n39:18.980 --> 39:19.980\n Like Larry Nassar.\n\n39:22.980 --> 39:24.380\n That's fun, huh?\n\n39:24.380 --> 39:25.220\n Joking, everybody.\n\n39:25.220 --> 39:26.840\n I hope nobody takes it seriously.\n\n39:28.180 --> 39:30.940\n I now have an amazing team of folks\n\n39:30.940 --> 39:31.940\n who help me with editing\n\n39:31.940 --> 39:33.700\n and they're now currently sweating.\n\n39:33.700 --> 39:34.540\n Watch this.\n\n39:34.540 --> 39:35.360\n We gotta leave that one in.\n\n39:35.360 --> 39:36.200\n That was quick.\n\n39:36.200 --> 39:37.020\n Yeah, that was pretty good.\n\n39:37.020 --> 39:37.860\n I'll leave that one.\n\n39:37.860 --> 39:38.700\n That was good.\n\n39:38.700 --> 39:40.860\n All right.\n\n39:40.860 --> 39:45.100\n So going in front of an audience,\n\n39:45.100 --> 39:48.180\n just even to give a lecture terrifies me,\n\n39:48.180 --> 39:49.940\n which I've done.\n\n39:49.940 --> 39:53.260\n But open mic, I mean, that to me,\n\n39:53.260 --> 39:55.600\n perhaps that's why I like going to open mics and listening\n\n39:55.600 --> 39:58.940\n is cause I just, it terrifies me so much,\n\n39:58.940 --> 40:02.620\n that idea of going up there and bombing.\n\n40:02.620 --> 40:03.720\n I mean, it's scary.\n\n40:03.720 --> 40:07.220\n And to do even like one minute, to be honest, is scary.\n\n40:07.220 --> 40:11.180\n And five minutes, I'm also watched enough open mics\n\n40:11.180 --> 40:13.060\n to realize that five minutes is a long time.\n\n40:13.060 --> 40:15.300\n I mean, it depends on your comedy,\n\n40:15.300 --> 40:18.800\n but if you're doing fast stuff,\n\n40:18.800 --> 40:20.500\n five minutes is a really long time.\n\n40:20.500 --> 40:22.420\n Oh, it's eternity.\n\n40:22.420 --> 40:26.300\n I guess with a long story, too, is a long time\n\n40:26.300 --> 40:27.840\n because if the story's not working,\n\n40:27.840 --> 40:29.020\n you're building up to something.\n\n40:29.020 --> 40:30.980\n If the story's gonna fail,\n\n40:30.980 --> 40:33.420\n you just spent all that time telling the story\n\n40:33.420 --> 40:35.500\n that completely went flat.\n\n40:35.500 --> 40:36.560\n Completely. Got nothing.\n\n40:36.560 --> 40:38.160\n I guess if you have a series of jokes,\n\n40:38.160 --> 40:39.700\n you can at least try to recover\n\n40:39.700 --> 40:41.340\n and like do the Mitch Hedberg thing\n\n40:41.340 --> 40:43.020\n where like, all right, I'll cross that off.\n\n40:43.020 --> 40:43.980\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n40:45.260 --> 40:48.780\n Well, I'm able to, like I've tried to write a few things\n\n40:48.780 --> 40:51.700\n and I'm able to tell that it's really bad.\n\n40:51.700 --> 40:54.380\n Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, well, that's better than most.\n\n40:54.380 --> 40:56.860\n Most people's egos kick in, they go, no, this is good.\n\n40:56.860 --> 40:59.180\n No, see, I'm able to introspect that.\n\n40:59.180 --> 41:00.620\n Like it seems funny.\n\n41:00.620 --> 41:03.460\n I mean, I guess the thing I'm looking for is original.\n\n41:03.460 --> 41:08.340\n Like there's easy stuff that you think is funny,\n\n41:08.340 --> 41:10.860\n but to me, originality is the thing\n\n41:10.860 --> 41:12.860\n you should be looking for because then,\n\n41:12.860 --> 41:17.180\n because then that's what's actually becomes funny.\n\n41:17.180 --> 41:21.740\n Like, or rather, if it's original,\n\n41:21.740 --> 41:25.320\n even if it bombs, that feels like more\n\n41:25.320 --> 41:27.820\n a beautiful art creation that you did.\n\n41:27.820 --> 41:29.720\n Like at least you swung for it.\n\n41:29.720 --> 41:30.980\n Like you did something unique.\n\n41:30.980 --> 41:33.860\n Cause like even with open mic, your first five minutes,\n\n41:33.860 --> 41:36.380\n there's so many, just go to enough open mics,\n\n41:36.380 --> 41:39.420\n you'll hear like all the, there's like a list of jokes\n\n41:39.420 --> 41:40.580\n that you can just go to.\n\n41:40.580 --> 41:42.240\n First of all, you can make fun of the fact\n\n41:42.240 --> 41:45.140\n that you're at open mic, that you're like doing this\n\n41:45.140 --> 41:46.840\n for the first time and so on.\n\n41:46.840 --> 41:49.100\n You could do a lot of stuff where you make fun\n\n41:49.100 --> 41:51.580\n of your appearance in some way and so on.\n\n41:51.580 --> 41:53.520\n But like, yeah, you could do that.\n\n41:53.520 --> 41:56.620\n You know, that takes actually, that's way harder\n\n41:56.620 --> 41:59.420\n than people realize to do it in an original way.\n\n41:59.420 --> 42:00.260\n Yes.\n\n42:00.260 --> 42:05.180\n You have to present who you are as a person very quickly,\n\n42:05.180 --> 42:07.900\n enough to then put that person down\n\n42:07.900 --> 42:09.620\n in front of everybody else.\n\n42:09.620 --> 42:11.540\n So you have to reveal the.\n\n42:11.540 --> 42:12.380\n The audience is like that,\n\n42:12.380 --> 42:13.840\n cause they go, he knows what we're thinking.\n\n42:13.840 --> 42:15.660\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n42:15.660 --> 42:17.340\n But do it again in an original way.\n\n42:17.340 --> 42:19.940\n And so like when I'm trying to write stuff,\n\n42:19.940 --> 42:23.820\n when I, not that I've tried long, it's like 30 minutes,\n\n42:23.820 --> 42:27.460\n but as enough to see like, oh shit,\n\n42:27.460 --> 42:29.980\n to write something original is really difficult.\n\n42:29.980 --> 42:32.300\n It is, but do you got a bit, anything?\n\n42:32.300 --> 42:33.140\n No.\n\n42:33.140 --> 42:34.580\n You didn't write any one line or anything?\n\n42:34.580 --> 42:35.400\n For this?\n\n42:35.400 --> 42:36.240\n No.\n\n42:36.240 --> 42:37.360\n Well, just in general, ever in your life,\n\n42:37.360 --> 42:38.200\n ever written a joke?\n\n42:38.200 --> 42:39.300\n Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n42:39.300 --> 42:40.140\n Oh, okay.\n\n42:40.140 --> 42:42.300\n No, but I don't have anything in my mind popped up.\n\n42:42.300 --> 42:47.300\n So the jokes that I've written have more,\n\n42:47.460 --> 42:50.860\n like for some reason my mind goes to like dark places.\n\n42:50.860 --> 42:55.600\n So, you know, like, and not actually dark\n\n42:55.600 --> 42:59.980\n in the Mark Norman dark, because you go really dark\n\n42:59.980 --> 43:01.740\n to where it's like almost absurd.\n\n43:01.740 --> 43:02.580\n Yes.\n\n43:02.580 --> 43:05.900\n My natural inclination is to go to like\n\n43:05.900 --> 43:10.900\n a dark historical like place, like Hitler and Stalin.\n\n43:11.020 --> 43:12.300\n Yeah.\n\n43:12.300 --> 43:15.840\n And almost, so go to that place\n\n43:15.840 --> 43:20.840\n and then talk about something absurd there.\n\n43:20.840 --> 43:25.840\n So like, don't go like all the way, I don't know.\n\n43:27.100 --> 43:29.860\n I don't want to give examples because it'd be clipped,\n\n43:29.860 --> 43:33.300\n but the Mark Norman style, look it up.\n\n43:33.300 --> 43:37.020\n He has a special on his YouTube, that kind.\n\n43:37.020 --> 43:39.340\n I want to almost explore the dark aspects\n\n43:39.340 --> 43:42.700\n of human nature more kind of connected\n\n43:42.700 --> 43:44.220\n to actual historical figures.\n\n43:44.220 --> 43:47.180\n That's the inclination.\n\n43:47.180 --> 43:48.900\n Like, I don't know, Nature's Metal,\n\n43:48.900 --> 43:51.500\n the Instagram channel that explores\n\n43:51.500 --> 43:55.420\n like the darkness of nature, like something there.\n\n43:55.420 --> 43:57.140\n See, that's good that you already know\n\n43:57.140 --> 43:59.180\n that you've kind of gotten to the core\n\n43:59.180 --> 44:00.420\n of your comedy already.\n\n44:00.420 --> 44:03.480\n And that's interesting, that's a step ahead.\n\n44:03.480 --> 44:05.860\n Yeah, I can hear, with most things that I do in life,\n\n44:05.860 --> 44:08.160\n I can like hear the music from a distance,\n\n44:08.160 --> 44:12.060\n like in myself, like, okay, if you have anything,\n\n44:12.060 --> 44:13.900\n this is the direction it'll be\n\n44:13.900 --> 44:16.220\n without actually knowing exactly all the steps.\n\n44:16.220 --> 44:18.140\n And that's a nice motivation to be like, all right,\n\n44:18.140 --> 44:19.860\n well, if you do this for a long time,\n\n44:19.860 --> 44:21.660\n maybe you'll have a chance to get there.\n\n44:21.660 --> 44:22.500\n Right.\n\n44:22.500 --> 44:25.220\n But you have to, that's where it's a feature\n\n44:25.220 --> 44:27.180\n to be super self critical, I think.\n\n44:27.180 --> 44:28.020\n Yes.\n\n44:28.020 --> 44:30.220\n But then that's why it's fucking terrifying\n\n44:30.220 --> 44:33.180\n to walk up to a stage, stand there,\n\n44:33.180 --> 44:34.700\n and probably forget everything.\n\n44:34.700 --> 44:36.480\n Yeah, that's the other part nobody thinks about.\n\n44:36.480 --> 44:37.900\n Just goes right out of your head.\n\n44:37.900 --> 44:39.820\n You go fight or flight, it's ugly.\n\n44:39.820 --> 44:43.740\n My first years were horrific bombing, horrific stammering,\n\n44:43.740 --> 44:45.500\n horrific not remembering the punchline.\n\n44:45.500 --> 44:48.040\n Like, you got to, maybe you got a set up going\n\n44:48.040 --> 44:49.260\n and they're kind of on board and you're like,\n\n44:49.260 --> 44:51.980\n ah, how's that, ah, camera, camera out it goes.\n\n44:51.980 --> 44:55.500\n And you just hate yourself, it's a nightmare.\n\n44:55.500 --> 44:57.020\n But you've already kind of,\n\n44:57.020 --> 44:58.620\n maybe if you haven't done standup or whatever,\n\n44:58.620 --> 45:02.780\n but you kind of know your voice and that's pretty advanced.\n\n45:02.780 --> 45:05.020\n So you're not trying to be somebody else, I guess.\n\n45:05.020 --> 45:07.600\n Yeah, just for having done like podcasts\n\n45:07.600 --> 45:09.140\n and lecture and so on.\n\n45:09.140 --> 45:09.980\n That helps.\n\n45:09.980 --> 45:12.700\n I've embarrassed, I've already done some of the work\n\n45:12.700 --> 45:15.140\n of the standups do, which is embarrass yourself\n\n45:15.140 --> 45:17.420\n in front of others for prolonged periods of time.\n\n45:17.420 --> 45:18.260\n Yes.\n\n45:18.260 --> 45:21.660\n Yeah, so I've done that without actually developing\n\n45:21.660 --> 45:22.500\n the funny.\n\n45:22.500 --> 45:23.580\n Right, right, right.\n\n45:23.580 --> 45:27.860\n But maybe the funny just is not that difficult to develop.\n\n45:28.820 --> 45:30.180\n No, it's super difficult, of course,\n\n45:30.180 --> 45:32.060\n but I mean, maybe the essential work\n\n45:32.060 --> 45:34.420\n of a standup comedian is just the embarrassment\n\n45:34.420 --> 45:36.120\n of like finding who you are.\n\n45:36.120 --> 45:37.780\n Yeah, that's a part of it for sure.\n\n45:37.780 --> 45:39.220\n You know, in the beginning you're like,\n\n45:39.220 --> 45:41.140\n water bottle, what's funny about water bottle?\n\n45:41.140 --> 45:42.580\n Hmm, I'm a funny guy, I can make this funny,\n\n45:42.580 --> 45:44.380\n but that ain't, that's not it, you know?\n\n45:44.380 --> 45:47.100\n It's your shit, your shit, like your dark stuff.\n\n45:47.100 --> 45:50.180\n For me, I tend to gravitate towards dark,\n\n45:50.180 --> 45:52.300\n but in a weird way where, you know,\n\n45:52.300 --> 45:54.660\n people will say like, hey, don't objectify women.\n\n45:54.660 --> 45:57.540\n But then they go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful.\n\n45:57.540 --> 46:00.900\n And you're like, well, wait, I know something's off here.\n\n46:00.900 --> 46:05.560\n Why can you objectify her, but not the supermodel?\n\n46:05.560 --> 46:06.760\n So what's going on there?\n\n46:06.760 --> 46:08.540\n And I like to play with that.\n\n46:08.540 --> 46:12.660\n So I have this joke where I say, Caitlyn Jenner,\n\n46:12.660 --> 46:15.220\n oh, women go, Caitlyn Jenner's beautiful, beautiful woman.\n\n46:15.220 --> 46:17.900\n I go, well, you look like her, and they go, fuck you.\n\n46:17.900 --> 46:20.200\n And you're like, there's a lot of truth there.\n\n46:20.200 --> 46:23.060\n But I like exploring that kind of,\n\n46:23.060 --> 46:24.620\n oh, you're trying to get one over on me,\n\n46:24.620 --> 46:27.180\n or you're lying to yourself, or what are we doing here?\n\n46:27.180 --> 46:29.020\n And I like that kind of comedy.\n\n46:30.260 --> 46:31.660\n I don't see color, well, I'm black.\n\n46:31.660 --> 46:32.500\n No, you're not.\n\n46:32.500 --> 46:36.060\n Ah, you know, that's fun, because you're lying.\n\n46:37.820 --> 46:42.320\n Yeah, okay, so like big time comedians such as yourself\n\n46:42.320 --> 46:45.100\n don't like to think of yourself in this way, but.\n\n46:45.100 --> 46:45.940\n There we go.\n\n46:45.940 --> 46:50.700\n Yeah, this is like where you over philosophize comedy, but.\n\n46:50.700 --> 46:51.700\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n46:51.700 --> 46:55.300\n It seems like comedians.\n\n46:55.300 --> 46:56.140\n Don't say important.\n\n46:56.140 --> 46:58.060\n Nothing worse than a comedian who thinks they're important.\n\n46:58.060 --> 47:00.220\n Yeah, so I was going, I was trying to find,\n\n47:00.220 --> 47:01.980\n as I was trying to say these words,\n\n47:01.980 --> 47:06.420\n I realized how cliche it is and how uninteresting it is.\n\n47:06.420 --> 47:09.620\n So I'm going to just, but there is something.\n\n47:09.620 --> 47:10.940\n I'm worried this whole thing is uninteresting.\n\n47:10.940 --> 47:12.260\n I'm like, who cares about comedy?\n\n47:12.260 --> 47:13.900\n There's like six comics on the planet.\n\n47:13.900 --> 47:15.020\n That nobody cares.\n\n47:15.020 --> 47:17.900\n Okay, I trust you in the pilot seat.\n\n47:17.900 --> 47:18.740\n You know what you're doing.\n\n47:18.740 --> 47:20.820\n You got listeners.\n\n47:20.820 --> 47:22.300\n They've tuned out long ago.\n\n47:22.300 --> 47:24.660\n Oh, you got Dan Carlin on here, huh?\n\n47:24.660 --> 47:25.620\n Is he around?\n\n47:25.620 --> 47:28.500\n Yeah, we're just going back and forth on Twitter just now.\n\n47:28.500 --> 47:29.500\n He's a huge fan.\n\n47:29.500 --> 47:30.540\n He was on here before.\n\n47:30.540 --> 47:31.740\n He'll be back.\n\n47:31.740 --> 47:35.860\n I've been actually really trying to volunteer myself\n\n47:35.860 --> 47:40.340\n aggressively with Dan Carlin for like a Russian episode\n\n47:40.340 --> 47:42.060\n where I can speak Russian.\n\n47:42.060 --> 47:44.140\n There's certain documents.\n\n47:44.140 --> 47:46.020\n I talked with Jaco about this too.\n\n47:46.020 --> 47:49.820\n Certain things, I mean, I just love the challenge\n\n47:49.820 --> 47:52.780\n of bringing Russian documents that I can read in Russian\n\n47:52.780 --> 47:55.740\n and then can translate and can try to capture\n\n47:55.740 --> 48:00.740\n the depth of the writing in the Russian language\n\n48:01.820 --> 48:03.620\n and communicate to the American audience.\n\n48:03.620 --> 48:05.020\n So much is lost in translation.\n\n48:05.020 --> 48:09.260\n Like there's so much pain and poetry in the Russian language.\n\n48:09.260 --> 48:10.860\n It's just connected to the culture.\n\n48:10.860 --> 48:13.020\n Every language, not every language,\n\n48:13.020 --> 48:18.020\n but many languages are uniquely able to capture\n\n48:18.260 --> 48:19.580\n the culture of the people.\n\n48:19.580 --> 48:21.460\n I mean, in some way they're the representation\n\n48:21.460 --> 48:23.140\n of the culture of the people.\n\n48:23.140 --> 48:24.780\n And so Russian is definitely that,\n\n48:24.780 --> 48:26.940\n like represents the full history and culture\n\n48:26.940 --> 48:28.860\n of the 20th century with all the atrocities,\n\n48:28.860 --> 48:32.140\n all the broken promises, all those kinds of things.\n\n48:32.140 --> 48:35.300\n Norm says Russian literature is,\n\n48:35.300 --> 48:38.340\n it's the most tapped into human existence than anything else.\n\n48:39.420 --> 48:40.260\n Norm.\n\n48:40.260 --> 48:41.100\n McDonald.\n\n48:41.100 --> 48:41.940\n Yeah.\n\n48:41.940 --> 48:43.100\n The Russian literature guy.\n\n48:43.100 --> 48:44.600\n Dostoevsky, all that shit.\n\n48:46.140 --> 48:48.220\n It's funny that there is a gap with comedians too.\n\n48:48.220 --> 48:50.260\n There's a culture of Russian comedy,\n\n48:50.260 --> 48:52.180\n like standup comedians that are totally.\n\n48:52.180 --> 48:53.180\n Is that right?\n\n48:53.180 --> 48:54.020\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n48:54.020 --> 48:55.540\n I don't know these Russians.\n\n48:55.540 --> 48:57.260\n I mean, I don't know today.\n\n48:57.260 --> 49:00.940\n I mean, more from the 80s and 90s and there's a.\n\n49:00.940 --> 49:01.780\n Yakov.\n\n49:02.700 --> 49:03.940\n That's all I know.\n\n49:03.940 --> 49:06.980\n That's not, so there's like a force, that's.\n\n49:06.980 --> 49:08.620\n I've never seen you that offended.\n\n49:08.620 --> 49:09.940\n No, no, no, it's not offended.\n\n49:09.940 --> 49:14.940\n There's a different, there's like the kinesins\n\n49:16.020 --> 49:18.460\n and there's the edgy.\n\n49:18.460 --> 49:19.480\n Is that Russian?\n\n49:20.400 --> 49:21.240\n What do you mean?\n\n49:21.240 --> 49:23.100\n Wait, I thought you said there was Russian comics.\n\n49:23.100 --> 49:25.260\n Yeah, Russian, I mean, I'm comparing them.\n\n49:25.260 --> 49:29.020\n I'm giving you like a style of darkness,\n\n49:29.020 --> 49:32.320\n like that's the kind of people that kind of challenge.\n\n49:33.860 --> 49:37.820\n They give, again, this is to how important comedians are,\n\n49:37.820 --> 49:42.220\n is they give a voice to people where in the Soviet Union,\n\n49:42.220 --> 49:46.440\n you really can't like express your opposition\n\n49:46.440 --> 49:47.540\n to the government.\n\n49:47.540 --> 49:52.100\n And so comedians are exceptionally important there\n\n49:52.100 --> 49:55.180\n for just, I don't know, channeling the anger,\n\n49:55.180 --> 49:57.260\n even when sometimes it's not the actual opposition\n\n49:57.260 --> 50:00.780\n to the government, they're just channeling the anger,\n\n50:00.780 --> 50:02.940\n the frustration with the absurdity of life.\n\n50:02.940 --> 50:05.800\n Like, you know, when there's a shortage of food,\n\n50:05.800 --> 50:10.460\n shortage of jobs, the absurdity of the bureaucracy,\n\n50:10.460 --> 50:13.560\n like the top heavy government,\n\n50:13.560 --> 50:17.860\n just all of that can only sometimes be expressed\n\n50:17.860 --> 50:20.580\n with like dark, absurd humor.\n\n50:20.580 --> 50:22.900\n And that actually, why there's a culture\n\n50:22.900 --> 50:24.780\n of that kind of humor, you know,\n\n50:24.780 --> 50:27.580\n you gather around the table with vodka\n\n50:27.580 --> 50:31.940\n and all you can do is just talk shit and just.\n\n50:31.940 --> 50:35.100\n Be offensive, say horrible shit, ball bust.\n\n50:35.100 --> 50:36.900\n I mean, I make school shooting jokes\n\n50:36.900 --> 50:37.900\n and people go, how do you do that?\n\n50:37.900 --> 50:39.880\n I'm like, well, maybe that's how I deal with it.\n\n50:39.880 --> 50:40.720\n Yeah.\n\n50:40.720 --> 50:45.580\n You know, like how come I gotta empathize the way you do?\n\n50:45.580 --> 50:46.680\n Maybe we're different.\n\n50:47.860 --> 50:50.860\n All right, so now let's skip the whole open mic thing\n\n50:50.860 --> 50:53.780\n and crafting jokes.\n\n50:53.780 --> 50:55.420\n Oh yeah, that's tough.\n\n50:55.420 --> 50:59.440\n Kerouac said, one day I will find the right words\n\n50:59.440 --> 51:00.820\n and they will be simple.\n\n51:02.140 --> 51:05.020\n When do you know the joke is done, it's perfect.\n\n51:05.020 --> 51:08.580\n You're somebody that does like really sharp,\n\n51:08.580 --> 51:11.820\n like fast jokes.\n\n51:11.820 --> 51:13.300\n Wow. Oh, thanks.\n\n51:13.300 --> 51:15.780\n So like there's somebody, I don't know,\n\n51:15.780 --> 51:18.660\n I don't know who you see yourself in the same school as,\n\n51:18.660 --> 51:23.660\n like you're darker and faster than Hedberg, I think,\n\n51:24.020 --> 51:26.820\n in terms of like, just, I don't know,\n\n51:26.820 --> 51:29.220\n the turns you take are very fast.\n\n51:29.220 --> 51:30.460\n Thanks, I appreciate it.\n\n51:30.460 --> 51:32.300\n I think I got some Norm Macdonald and maybe.\n\n51:32.300 --> 51:33.140\n Oh, Norm, that's right.\n\n51:33.140 --> 51:34.940\n You know, obviously Norm,\n\n51:34.940 --> 51:36.980\n but Chris Rock was huge for me.\n\n51:36.980 --> 51:40.420\n Chris Rock, old like 90s Chris Rock was like,\n\n51:40.420 --> 51:41.860\n I didn't know you could do jokes like that.\n\n51:41.860 --> 51:44.040\n I always loved George Carlin and Groucho Marx\n\n51:44.040 --> 51:47.260\n and Bill Murray, there's so many different types of comedy.\n\n51:47.260 --> 51:50.440\n But when I saw the bigger and blacker bring the pain,\n\n51:50.440 --> 51:54.020\n I was like, oh my God, this is like, it hit me.\n\n51:54.020 --> 51:54.860\n So that was big.\n\n51:54.860 --> 51:57.220\n And then Norm's just like the funniest guy on the planet.\n\n51:57.220 --> 51:59.460\n So him being the smartest guy in the room,\n\n51:59.460 --> 52:01.420\n but acting dumb was great.\n\n52:01.420 --> 52:06.420\n So yeah, Chris Rock has that way of cutting to the bullshit,\n\n52:06.980 --> 52:08.420\n which I mentioned earlier.\n\n52:08.420 --> 52:09.980\n I liked that cutting through the bullshit\n\n52:09.980 --> 52:12.860\n kind of style of comedy, because you kind of go,\n\n52:12.860 --> 52:13.780\n oh, I'm not crazy.\n\n52:13.780 --> 52:15.060\n That's what I thought too.\n\n52:15.060 --> 52:16.740\n I was too scared to say it, but I thought that.\n\n52:16.740 --> 52:19.500\n And he's saying it in a room of people are laughing.\n\n52:19.500 --> 52:21.300\n Maybe I'm not an idiot.\n\n52:21.300 --> 52:22.900\n So that helped me.\n\n52:22.900 --> 52:27.260\n So it's observational, but not Jerry Seinfeld\n\n52:27.260 --> 52:30.500\n observational, it's like going to the darker thing.\n\n52:30.500 --> 52:32.420\n To like within society.\n\n52:32.420 --> 52:34.980\n But I like him too, but seeing it,\n\n52:34.980 --> 52:38.900\n doing it about stuff like in your life, society.\n\n52:38.900 --> 52:42.680\n Yeah, race, gender, government, politics,\n\n52:42.680 --> 52:43.520\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n52:43.520 --> 52:46.300\n Exactly, exactly, sex, human emotions,\n\n52:46.300 --> 52:48.800\n jealousy, whatever it is, that's the good stuff.\n\n52:50.300 --> 52:52.260\n How'd you feel when Norm passed away?\n\n52:52.260 --> 52:57.140\n Ah, that was a bummer because he was, you know what, 61.\n\n52:57.140 --> 53:00.500\n And I just didn't see it coming.\n\n53:00.500 --> 53:04.220\n And I just, I've watched so many hours of his stuff\n\n53:04.220 --> 53:07.020\n and I've met him and he's like,\n\n53:07.020 --> 53:09.300\n he was like this comedic bar, like, hey, we got Norm.\n\n53:09.300 --> 53:10.960\n You know, there's so much shit comedy.\n\n53:10.960 --> 53:13.380\n Then you see Norm and you're like, this is next level.\n\n53:13.380 --> 53:15.500\n This is savant type shit.\n\n53:15.500 --> 53:19.900\n And then to lose him is like, ah, Norm had 20 more years\n\n53:19.900 --> 53:23.160\n at least of just content and content and thoughts\n\n53:23.160 --> 53:24.700\n and his point of view.\n\n53:24.700 --> 53:27.540\n And that's, we'll never get that and that sucks.\n\n53:27.540 --> 53:29.340\n Yeah, there is something about artists\n\n53:29.340 --> 53:32.020\n like Jimi Hendrix dying too early.\n\n53:32.020 --> 53:34.060\n It's like, you wonder.\n\n53:34.060 --> 53:35.020\n What was next?\n\n53:35.020 --> 53:36.180\n Yeah, what was next?\n\n53:36.180 --> 53:39.880\n But then part of it is like, you know,\n\n53:39.880 --> 53:43.260\n it all ends for all of us and it's like walking away early\n\n53:44.220 --> 53:47.860\n is kind of admirable.\n\n53:47.860 --> 53:50.780\n It's almost like I did a pretty good job.\n\n53:50.780 --> 53:51.620\n Yeah.\n\n53:51.620 --> 53:53.780\n I'm good with that.\n\n53:53.780 --> 53:56.580\n And especially the way he did, which is not telling anybody.\n\n53:56.580 --> 53:59.580\n I know, nine years, his best friends didn't even know.\n\n53:59.580 --> 54:01.540\n And in this world of like victimhood\n\n54:01.540 --> 54:03.820\n and I need clicks and I need people to love me,\n\n54:03.820 --> 54:05.660\n he could have, he got, you know, canceled\n\n54:05.660 --> 54:06.700\n and yelled at and in trouble\n\n54:06.700 --> 54:09.060\n and he could have pulled that cancer card and he never did.\n\n54:09.060 --> 54:11.780\n I mean, the integrity on this motherfucker.\n\n54:11.780 --> 54:13.180\n Did you get a chance to interact with him?\n\n54:13.180 --> 54:15.180\n Like what, how often did you meet him?\n\n54:15.180 --> 54:17.600\n I met him once at the Comedy Cellar\n\n54:17.600 --> 54:19.460\n and we chatted for five minutes\n\n54:19.460 --> 54:21.900\n and then he went on and did the Letterman set that he did.\n\n54:21.900 --> 54:23.460\n He was running the Letterman set.\n\n54:23.460 --> 54:26.880\n And sweet guy, nice guy, didn't know him that well,\n\n54:26.880 --> 54:29.000\n but I mean, he's just brilliant.\n\n54:29.000 --> 54:33.140\n And I also love a brilliant guy who does stupid stuff.\n\n54:33.140 --> 54:36.460\n That's a fun, fun little combo there.\n\n54:36.460 --> 54:40.380\n Like silly guys who are actually brilliant also.\n\n54:40.380 --> 54:42.440\n You know, like Louis CK is a brilliant comic\n\n54:42.440 --> 54:45.960\n and he'll do a joke about farting on a kid.\n\n54:45.960 --> 54:46.940\n And you're like, that's great\n\n54:46.940 --> 54:49.560\n that he still finds farts funny\n\n54:49.560 --> 54:52.100\n and he's also this comedic genius guy.\n\n54:52.100 --> 54:53.460\n I like that.\n\n54:53.460 --> 54:55.420\n And doesn't really acknowledge the genius.\n\n54:55.420 --> 54:57.260\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n54:57.260 --> 55:00.740\n Yeah, I like smart people, they're silly.\n\n55:00.740 --> 55:02.860\n Yes, that's a good combo.\n\n55:02.860 --> 55:04.180\n Like you said, Elon is silly.\n\n55:04.180 --> 55:06.100\n Yeah, yeah, super silly. Yeah, that's great.\n\n55:06.100 --> 55:08.380\n Cause we taught, we teach kids like,\n\n55:08.380 --> 55:10.140\n hey, put that down, stop that,\n\n55:10.140 --> 55:12.340\n quit cutting up, quit horsing around.\n\n55:12.340 --> 55:14.980\n But maybe that's some kind of sign of brilliance there.\n\n55:14.980 --> 55:19.760\n Yeah, being like childlike and silly is a kind of wisdom.\n\n55:19.760 --> 55:21.620\n I feel like those people are way wiser\n\n55:21.620 --> 55:23.980\n than the people that, no offense to me,\n\n55:23.980 --> 55:26.940\n wear a suit and take themselves way too seriously.\n\n55:26.940 --> 55:28.540\n No, but you got a spark in you.\n\n55:28.540 --> 55:29.380\n A little bit.\n\n55:29.380 --> 55:31.180\n You got a little, what's the word?\n\n55:31.180 --> 55:34.580\n Not elf, imp.\n\n55:34.580 --> 55:35.680\n Little imp in you.\n\n55:35.680 --> 55:36.520\n Give that a go.\n\n55:36.520 --> 55:38.060\n You know what imp?\n\n55:38.060 --> 55:40.580\n Little mischievous, it's like a little.\n\n55:40.580 --> 55:43.220\n Is that a Tolkien character, imp?\n\n55:43.220 --> 55:44.040\n Yeah, might be.\n\n55:44.040 --> 55:45.940\n An imp is a European mythological being\n\n55:45.940 --> 55:47.580\n similar to a fairy or a demon.\n\n55:47.580 --> 55:49.180\n Are you calling me a fairy?\n\n55:49.180 --> 55:50.820\n Frequently, no, okay.\n\n55:50.820 --> 55:53.780\n Similar to a fairy or a demon.\n\n55:53.780 --> 55:55.220\n I feel like that's a big leap.\n\n55:55.220 --> 55:58.620\n Big leap, yeah, that's not a great info bio there.\n\n55:58.620 --> 56:01.280\n Frequently described in folklore and superstition,\n\n56:01.280 --> 56:04.620\n the word may perhaps derive from the term imps,\n\n56:04.620 --> 56:08.580\n but with a Y, used to denote a young grafted tree.\n\n56:09.860 --> 56:11.100\n It's a little mischievous.\n\n56:11.100 --> 56:12.060\n You got a twinkle.\n\n56:12.060 --> 56:13.820\n You're the serious buttoned up guy,\n\n56:13.820 --> 56:14.940\n but there's a twinkle.\n\n56:14.940 --> 56:16.500\n There's a twinkle.\n\n56:16.500 --> 56:17.900\n And the audience can see the twinkle,\n\n56:17.900 --> 56:21.420\n and that's why you resonate, I think.\n\n56:21.420 --> 56:22.540\n I'm sorry.\n\n56:22.540 --> 56:25.880\n Deep Analysis by Mark Norman, Psychological Analysis.\n\n56:25.880 --> 56:28.860\n Okay, but then back to the crafting of the joke.\n\n56:28.860 --> 56:30.660\n You said Chris Rock and Norm Macdonald.\n\n56:30.660 --> 56:35.380\n What for you, how do you know when the joke is done?\n\n56:35.380 --> 56:37.780\n Are there some jokes that you're proud of?\n\n56:37.780 --> 56:40.960\n Wow, that's well done.\n\n56:40.960 --> 56:43.340\n Yeah, the joke is done.\n\n56:43.340 --> 56:44.300\n It's a tough question\n\n56:44.300 --> 56:45.500\n because there's so many different kinds of jokes.\n\n56:45.500 --> 56:48.340\n There's what we call a chunk, which is a big idea\n\n56:48.340 --> 56:50.140\n with a bunch of jokes in the middle of it,\n\n56:50.140 --> 56:53.180\n and then a big crescendo at the end.\n\n56:53.180 --> 56:54.640\n Or there's a one liner,\n\n56:54.640 --> 56:57.660\n or there's a tag of a joke that's also a joke.\n\n56:57.660 --> 57:01.620\n So the jokes come in different,\n\n57:01.620 --> 57:02.620\n like I have a joke where I say,\n\n57:02.620 --> 57:04.500\n I met my girl in that Jewish app.\n\n57:04.500 --> 57:06.660\n What's that Jewish app called?\n\n57:06.660 --> 57:08.020\n PayPal.\n\n57:08.020 --> 57:08.860\n Nice.\n\n57:08.860 --> 57:11.340\n That's the hell, that's what they're asking you\n\n57:11.340 --> 57:15.540\n to want from the crowd, but it's a fun turn\n\n57:15.540 --> 57:17.100\n because you say your thing\n\n57:17.100 --> 57:18.420\n and then I hit you with a misdirect\n\n57:18.420 --> 57:19.420\n and that's what a joke is.\n\n57:19.420 --> 57:22.820\n A joke is basically me saying something that makes sense,\n\n57:22.820 --> 57:24.500\n but you didn't see it coming.\n\n57:24.500 --> 57:26.200\n And that's a perfect example of that.\n\n57:26.200 --> 57:29.140\n So that joke took forever to figure out, by the way.\n\n57:29.140 --> 57:32.700\n You have to go to different services like PayPal.\n\n57:32.700 --> 57:33.580\n What's funniest?\n\n57:33.580 --> 57:35.820\n Exactly, and I figured PayPal is funny\n\n57:35.820 --> 57:38.060\n because it has the word pay in it.\n\n57:38.060 --> 57:42.060\n Venmo, it's also not really a good word, Venmo, PayPal.\n\n57:42.060 --> 57:43.140\n It just hits better.\n\n57:43.140 --> 57:44.780\n Yeah, PayPal is funnier somehow.\n\n57:44.780 --> 57:45.620\n It's funnier somehow,\n\n57:45.620 --> 57:46.460\n and that's the beauty of comedy.\n\n57:46.460 --> 57:47.920\n There's a weird little magic into it.\n\n57:47.920 --> 57:50.120\n You can get technical all day and formulaic,\n\n57:50.120 --> 57:53.620\n but there's still that little bit of fairy dust\n\n57:53.620 --> 57:55.820\n that you don't know why this is funnier.\n\n57:55.820 --> 57:56.700\n Or imp dust.\n\n57:56.700 --> 57:58.900\n Imp dust, yes.\n\n57:58.900 --> 58:00.880\n With a Y, okay.\n\n58:00.880 --> 58:02.600\n So you know what joke is done when it kills,\n\n58:02.600 --> 58:04.620\n and this is a roundness to a joke\n\n58:04.620 --> 58:06.380\n when you feel like this is buttoned up.\n\n58:06.380 --> 58:07.840\n This is done here.\n\n58:07.840 --> 58:09.960\n Is simplicity the right word there?\n\n58:09.960 --> 58:10.820\n Yeah.\n\n58:10.820 --> 58:12.700\n Is it like you're chopping stuff away\n\n58:12.700 --> 58:13.600\n or are you adding stuff?\n\n58:13.600 --> 58:14.560\n Like what does it feel like?\n\n58:14.560 --> 58:17.220\n Simplicity is always the best angle.\n\n58:17.220 --> 58:19.360\n I mean, you can get real high concept with a joke\n\n58:19.360 --> 58:22.100\n and still make it work, but the simpler the better.\n\n58:22.100 --> 58:24.900\n I saw Dave Chappelle on stage once,\n\n58:24.900 --> 58:28.100\n and Chris Rock and Demetri Martin were in the back\n\n58:28.100 --> 58:30.500\n watching in awe, and Dave Chappelle,\n\n58:30.500 --> 58:31.340\n I can't remember the joke,\n\n58:31.340 --> 58:33.940\n but he said something about sex or women,\n\n58:33.940 --> 58:36.980\n and Demetri Martin goes, eh, it's a little easy.\n\n58:36.980 --> 58:39.360\n And Chris Rock goes, that's why it's good.\n\n58:39.360 --> 58:41.140\n And I remember hearing that as some young comic,\n\n58:41.140 --> 58:44.540\n like ah, I'm getting this comedy lesson right here\n\n58:44.540 --> 58:46.260\n for these two titans.\n\n58:46.260 --> 58:47.700\n And so that was fun.\n\n58:47.700 --> 58:48.980\n Simple is key.\n\n58:48.980 --> 58:50.140\n So the easy is okay.\n\n58:50.140 --> 58:55.060\n That's such a weird, I think I remember reading\n\n58:55.060 --> 58:57.540\n or hearing Eminem say something about\n\n58:57.540 --> 58:58.860\n maybe the song Slim Shade.\n\n58:58.860 --> 59:02.020\n One of the songs, he's like, I knew it was gonna be good\n\n59:02.020 --> 59:05.580\n because it got really repetitive\n\n59:05.580 --> 59:08.060\n and annoying very quickly or something like that.\n\n59:08.060 --> 59:10.500\n I mean, that's the sort of the music equivalent\n\n59:10.500 --> 59:12.900\n of it's too easy.\n\n59:12.900 --> 59:16.100\n Like if it's like super catchy, as a musician,\n\n59:16.100 --> 59:19.740\n you might get very quickly bored of it.\n\n59:19.740 --> 59:23.340\n Or like as you're creating it, no, it's too easy.\n\n59:23.340 --> 59:26.860\n It's like there needs to be some more complexity to it.\n\n59:26.860 --> 59:28.960\n I like complexity, but the best guys\n\n59:28.960 --> 59:33.580\n who are the ones who make complex shit look simple.\n\n59:33.580 --> 59:36.940\n Like you ever heard that Ben Franklin story\n\n59:36.940 --> 59:37.780\n where he's talking to his friend,\n\n59:37.780 --> 59:39.600\n his friend's like, I'm gonna start a hat store.\n\n59:39.600 --> 59:43.660\n So he puts a sign out, says, hats for sale, $12.\n\n59:43.660 --> 59:46.300\n And Ben Franklin looks at it, he goes,\n\n59:46.300 --> 59:47.580\n well, you don't need the $12\n\n59:47.580 --> 59:50.060\n because all they need to know is that you got hats for sale.\n\n59:50.060 --> 59:50.900\n He's like, all right.\n\n59:50.900 --> 59:53.140\n So he loses the $12, makes a new sign, hats for sale.\n\n59:53.140 --> 59:55.740\n And he goes, you don't really need for sale\n\n59:55.740 --> 59:57.060\n because it's a business.\n\n59:57.060 --> 59:58.600\n People can put that together.\n\n59:58.600 --> 59:59.500\n So he just goes, all right.\n\n59:59.500 --> 1:00:01.260\n He makes a new sign, it says hats.\n\n1:00:01.260 --> 1:00:03.740\n And then Ben Franklin's like, you know,\n\n1:00:03.740 --> 1:00:05.360\n you don't really need the word hat.\n\n1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:07.080\n You can just put a picture of a hat.\n\n1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:08.820\n And he made a new sign, which is a picture of a hat\n\n1:00:08.820 --> 1:00:10.420\n and it like helped the business or something.\n\n1:00:10.420 --> 1:00:12.420\n That's like some old wives tale or whatever.\n\n1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:14.940\n But I think about that all the time when I'm writing.\n\n1:00:14.940 --> 1:00:17.280\n I thought this was going to like, there was no sign.\n\n1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:19.140\n It went like super like nihilistic.\n\n1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:21.200\n Oh, maybe, maybe, that could work too.\n\n1:00:23.060 --> 1:00:26.620\n What, like as a comedian, so I'm a fan of yours.\n\n1:00:26.620 --> 1:00:29.300\n I enjoy, I really enjoy you in conversations.\n\n1:00:29.300 --> 1:00:30.140\n Wow.\n\n1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:31.940\n Now I'm getting nothing out of it.\n\n1:00:31.940 --> 1:00:35.020\n This is like emotion.\n\n1:00:35.020 --> 1:00:36.540\n You're tough not to read.\n\n1:00:36.540 --> 1:00:37.680\n Cold inside.\n\n1:00:38.820 --> 1:00:40.820\n I mean, just the quickness you have,\n\n1:00:40.820 --> 1:00:43.220\n obviously you're also a great stand up comedian.\n\n1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:46.420\n What's your favorite medium to shine in?\n\n1:00:46.420 --> 1:00:50.100\n So you have a podcast yourself, an excellent podcast.\n\n1:00:51.660 --> 1:00:53.500\n You're often a podcast guest.\n\n1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:55.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:56.780\n Which is always fun to listen to,\n\n1:00:56.780 --> 1:00:58.540\n how you're going to deal with the different people.\n\n1:00:58.540 --> 1:01:00.260\n You're great on Rogan.\n\n1:01:00.260 --> 1:01:01.100\n Oh, thanks.\n\n1:01:02.300 --> 1:01:04.120\n What do you enjoy most?\n\n1:01:04.120 --> 1:01:07.300\n Podcasts are great because you can stretch out a little more.\n\n1:01:07.300 --> 1:01:08.620\n You can breathe a little.\n\n1:01:08.620 --> 1:01:09.540\n You know, with a stand up set,\n\n1:01:09.540 --> 1:01:11.860\n I like to be like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n1:01:11.860 --> 1:01:14.940\n But podcasts are great because it's conversational.\n\n1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:16.820\n So you can be, it's almost like you're being funny\n\n1:01:16.820 --> 1:01:18.140\n with your friends.\n\n1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:20.400\n Whereas a stage is like a, this is a piece.\n\n1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:21.760\n This is a presentation.\n\n1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:25.220\n But I think the podcast is great,\n\n1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:26.980\n but you don't get the reaction.\n\n1:01:26.980 --> 1:01:29.180\n Unless the host is laughing, you can't hear the guy\n\n1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:32.380\n in his car in New Jersey driving to work going, ah!\n\n1:01:32.380 --> 1:01:33.580\n Every now and then I'll read a comment like,\n\n1:01:33.580 --> 1:01:35.140\n I spit out my coffee when you said this.\n\n1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:37.580\n And I'm like, but it's not immediate.\n\n1:01:37.580 --> 1:01:38.400\n You want the immediate.\n\n1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:40.500\n So stand up will always be number one,\n\n1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:44.420\n but there's no better feeling than killing in a room\n\n1:01:44.420 --> 1:01:46.060\n of people who don't know who you are.\n\n1:01:46.060 --> 1:01:48.220\n Strangers, you're in the middle of nowhere.\n\n1:01:48.220 --> 1:01:49.420\n You left your wife at home.\n\n1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:50.540\n You left your kids.\n\n1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:51.740\n You left your house.\n\n1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:54.220\n You're in the middle of bumfucked Dickville\n\n1:01:54.220 --> 1:01:58.740\n and murdering for these hillbilly nobody, whatever it is.\n\n1:01:58.740 --> 1:02:02.060\n And they're slinging their beers and cheering you on.\n\n1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:05.220\n And they carry out and you fuck some fat lady\n\n1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:07.220\n and you leave and you get back to your hotel\n\n1:02:07.220 --> 1:02:09.360\n and you go, holy shit, what was that?\n\n1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:10.580\n No one will ever know about it.\n\n1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:12.620\n Just lost in the ether.\n\n1:02:12.620 --> 1:02:14.420\n That's the best feeling.\n\n1:02:14.420 --> 1:02:15.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:17.660\n Killing an obscurity as Bill Burr would say.\n\n1:02:19.340 --> 1:02:20.700\n Yeah, this is one of the things that sucks\n\n1:02:20.700 --> 1:02:22.260\n about giving lectures.\n\n1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:27.260\n Like at universities or giving lectures in general\n\n1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:31.980\n is when you look at the audience, you know,\n\n1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:33.860\n several hundred students,\n\n1:02:33.860 --> 1:02:36.140\n they all have a bored look on their face.\n\n1:02:36.140 --> 1:02:36.980\n Yeah, of course.\n\n1:02:36.980 --> 1:02:40.100\n Like my face now probably looks bored,\n\n1:02:40.100 --> 1:02:42.420\n but I'm actually excited to be talking to you.\n\n1:02:42.420 --> 1:02:44.380\n But there's something about just,\n\n1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:46.860\n there's something about a comedy called,\n\n1:02:46.860 --> 1:02:49.000\n maybe this is the contingent of laughter,\n\n1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.740\n but like it gives people the freedom to just laugh,\n\n1:02:51.740 --> 1:02:54.140\n to like, to remove that facade of like,\n\n1:02:54.140 --> 1:02:58.100\n you don't have to pretend like you don't care.\n\n1:02:58.100 --> 1:02:59.660\n Like if you care, you can show it\n\n1:02:59.660 --> 1:03:01.580\n and you can have fun with it a lot.\n\n1:03:01.580 --> 1:03:03.780\n Probably liquor helps out too.\n\n1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:05.280\n Yeah, it helps for sure.\n\n1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:06.900\n But there is a, especially,\n\n1:03:06.900 --> 1:03:09.420\n and that's why comedy I think is so popular right now\n\n1:03:09.420 --> 1:03:12.500\n because HR is up our ass.\n\n1:03:12.500 --> 1:03:15.400\n We're scared of old tweets that might come back to haunt us.\n\n1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:17.220\n What did I say on that interview?\n\n1:03:17.220 --> 1:03:18.740\n Even people at offices are like,\n\n1:03:18.740 --> 1:03:22.100\n I put something on Facebook in 1999\n\n1:03:22.100 --> 1:03:24.360\n that was about fat tits that I liked.\n\n1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:25.860\n Should I get rid of that?\n\n1:03:25.860 --> 1:03:28.820\n Even people say like, there's no cancel, whatever.\n\n1:03:28.820 --> 1:03:30.980\n There is something in the air right now\n\n1:03:30.980 --> 1:03:32.420\n that wasn't there before.\n\n1:03:32.420 --> 1:03:34.580\n It's the video, I'm a Karen,\n\n1:03:34.580 --> 1:03:36.620\n I got caught at Trader Joe, whatever it is.\n\n1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:37.860\n People rat on each other now,\n\n1:03:37.860 --> 1:03:40.040\n everybody's tattletaling because they want the clicks.\n\n1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:42.580\n It's a horrible society we've crafted.\n\n1:03:42.580 --> 1:03:46.860\n But standup comedy gets you to come out,\n\n1:03:46.860 --> 1:03:48.700\n and now people do it at standup shows too.\n\n1:03:48.700 --> 1:03:50.300\n Sadly, but it gets you to come out\n\n1:03:50.300 --> 1:03:52.360\n and let that inhibition down.\n\n1:03:52.360 --> 1:03:53.200\n Because we're all human,\n\n1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:55.340\n we've all had the fucked up thoughts like,\n\n1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:56.980\n man, that guy's fat as shit.\n\n1:03:56.980 --> 1:03:57.940\n It doesn't mean you hate the guy,\n\n1:03:57.940 --> 1:03:58.820\n it doesn't mean you hate fat people,\n\n1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:00.220\n it doesn't mean you're fat shaming.\n\n1:04:00.220 --> 1:04:01.520\n But you can't say that at the office.\n\n1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:03.000\n You can't go, Bob, you're fat as shit.\n\n1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.920\n You'll get fired for body shaming.\n\n1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:08.180\n But at the club, you go, that guy's fat as shit.\n\n1:04:08.180 --> 1:04:10.940\n The crowd goes, he is fat as shit.\n\n1:04:10.940 --> 1:04:12.140\n And it's this weird cathartic thing\n\n1:04:12.140 --> 1:04:14.140\n because all we do is tamp shit down.\n\n1:04:14.140 --> 1:04:15.340\n It's kind of like you ever meet a girl\n\n1:04:15.340 --> 1:04:17.280\n who's like all prim and proper in the bedroom.\n\n1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:18.780\n She's like, put a lamp up my ass.\n\n1:04:18.780 --> 1:04:20.700\n Ah, you know, whatever it is.\n\n1:04:20.700 --> 1:04:22.900\n It's because we gotta get it out.\n\n1:04:22.900 --> 1:04:24.900\n We're all repressed in some way.\n\n1:04:24.900 --> 1:04:27.660\n So I guess what you're saying is comedy's important.\n\n1:04:27.660 --> 1:04:31.800\n Yes, callback.\n\n1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:32.640\n All right.\n\n1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:33.460\n Well played, sir.\n\n1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:34.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:34.300 --> 1:04:35.940\n What do you think about Austin?\n\n1:04:35.940 --> 1:04:37.420\n What do you think about the comedy scene in Austin?\n\n1:04:37.420 --> 1:04:39.780\n We talk about LA and New York.\n\n1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:42.300\n What do you think about what Joe's trying to create there?\n\n1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:46.620\n So I should say that the reason I moved to Austin,\n\n1:04:46.620 --> 1:04:48.980\n I have this dream of, it wouldn't be funny\n\n1:04:48.980 --> 1:04:50.900\n if I said this dream of becoming a comedian.\n\n1:04:50.900 --> 1:04:51.740\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:04:51.740 --> 1:04:53.940\n It's an audience, at least.\n\n1:04:53.940 --> 1:04:55.220\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n1:04:55.220 --> 1:04:56.380\n You know, I always said you can hear\n\n1:04:56.380 --> 1:04:57.460\n the music in the distance.\n\n1:04:57.460 --> 1:04:59.980\n I have this dream around robotics\n\n1:04:59.980 --> 1:05:01.900\n and artificial intelligence, whether it's a company,\n\n1:05:01.900 --> 1:05:05.220\n whether it's something else that I was just pulling me to.\n\n1:05:05.220 --> 1:05:06.700\n I actually wanted to move to San Francisco,\n\n1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:08.960\n and then all my friends in San Francisco said,\n\n1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:09.900\n no, it's the wrong place.\n\n1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:10.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:12.020 --> 1:05:16.180\n At this time, the cynicism there\n\n1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:20.380\n is just not conducive to taking big leaps\n\n1:05:20.380 --> 1:05:23.540\n into the unknown, excited about the future kind of thing.\n\n1:05:23.540 --> 1:05:28.100\n And Austin was that, for me in particular with Elon Musk,\n\n1:05:28.100 --> 1:05:30.500\n but also just the energy that everybody had,\n\n1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:34.540\n including Joe, the excitement about the future.\n\n1:05:34.540 --> 1:05:37.100\n I don't care if Austin burns to the ground\n\n1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:39.000\n and it actually is a complete failure.\n\n1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:42.980\n Being excited about the future seems to be,\n\n1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:44.380\n like optimism about the future,\n\n1:05:44.380 --> 1:05:47.140\n seems to be the thing that actually\n\n1:05:47.140 --> 1:05:49.580\n makes that future happen, makes a great future happen.\n\n1:05:49.580 --> 1:05:53.560\n So it's always cool for me to see Joe\n\n1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:57.860\n super excited about creating a culture in Austin,\n\n1:05:57.860 --> 1:06:01.420\n like making it a comedy hub.\n\n1:06:01.420 --> 1:06:02.700\n I don't want to overstate it,\n\n1:06:02.700 --> 1:06:05.380\n but I think he really believes it'll be\n\n1:06:05.380 --> 1:06:09.260\n a very big place for comedy in the United States\n\n1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:10.500\n and generally in the world.\n\n1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:13.500\n And so just even believing that, that's powerful.\n\n1:06:13.500 --> 1:06:14.340\n I agree.\n\n1:06:14.340 --> 1:06:18.700\n You start to make it happen, that energy is there.\n\n1:06:18.700 --> 1:06:21.220\n Anyway, so, but that's for me from just an outsider\n\n1:06:21.220 --> 1:06:23.000\n watching the fun of it.\n\n1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.060\n I should also mention for less of an outsider,\n\n1:06:26.060 --> 1:06:29.120\n more insider in the martial arts world,\n\n1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:32.100\n partially probably because of Joe, I'm not sure,\n\n1:06:32.100 --> 1:06:36.220\n like John Donahar, Gordon Ryan, the B Team,\n\n1:06:36.220 --> 1:06:38.700\n all of those folks, those are, that might be gibberish\n\n1:06:38.700 --> 1:06:42.580\n to you, but those are like some of the greatest grapplers\n\n1:06:42.580 --> 1:06:43.820\n in martial artists of all time.\n\n1:06:43.820 --> 1:06:46.900\n So it's also becoming this hub of martial arts.\n\n1:06:46.900 --> 1:06:49.860\n So the whole thing is just beautiful.\n\n1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:52.880\n Anyway, what are your thoughts about that scene?\n\n1:06:52.880 --> 1:06:55.940\n Well, there's a lot here, a lot of things to mention.\n\n1:06:55.940 --> 1:07:00.820\n One, I think Joe did do that to a degree,\n\n1:07:00.820 --> 1:07:03.140\n like all these people, Segura lives there now,\n\n1:07:03.140 --> 1:07:04.500\n a lot of comics live there.\n\n1:07:04.500 --> 1:07:07.580\n He's opening clubs, other clubs are opening.\n\n1:07:07.580 --> 1:07:08.860\n I think it's happening.\n\n1:07:08.860 --> 1:07:10.300\n That's the other thing is people go,\n\n1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:12.420\n everybody's moving to Austin, Austin's the new hub.\n\n1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:13.820\n And then they look at their watch and they go,\n\n1:07:13.820 --> 1:07:15.340\n five minutes went by, nothing changed.\n\n1:07:15.340 --> 1:07:19.900\n It's gonna take years, but everybody wants it now, now, now.\n\n1:07:20.820 --> 1:07:23.860\n What, Austin, there's no industry there.\n\n1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:25.340\n There's no Netflix, whatever.\n\n1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:27.300\n And you're like, yeah, I know, but it needs a minute.\n\n1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:28.580\n You can't just do this overnight.\n\n1:07:28.580 --> 1:07:30.040\n So people forget that.\n\n1:07:30.040 --> 1:07:33.220\n So it could happen huge, just give it some time.\n\n1:07:33.220 --> 1:07:35.060\n I mean, he's opening a club, I went and saw it.\n\n1:07:35.060 --> 1:07:37.980\n It's incredible, like it's so perfect for comedy.\n\n1:07:37.980 --> 1:07:39.900\n It's every detail, it's incredible.\n\n1:07:39.900 --> 1:07:44.020\n But so it could happen still.\n\n1:07:44.020 --> 1:07:47.200\n I do think there's a little biting off more\n\n1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:50.860\n than they can chew with Austin because it's not that big.\n\n1:07:50.860 --> 1:07:51.700\n So like.\n\n1:07:51.700 --> 1:07:52.520\n And it's spread out.\n\n1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:53.360\n I mean, yeah, it's not big.\n\n1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:57.420\n And the infrastructure is not quite there to support it.\n\n1:07:57.420 --> 1:08:01.860\n But it has a lot of, comparing from the tech side,\n\n1:08:03.100 --> 1:08:04.960\n it has a lot of land to expand into.\n\n1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:07.260\n So it might become this. That helps.\n\n1:08:07.260 --> 1:08:08.800\n Like you're basically establishing,\n\n1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:10.020\n it's kind of like when you're in New York,\n\n1:08:10.020 --> 1:08:12.780\n you're establishing these whole neighborhoods.\n\n1:08:12.780 --> 1:08:14.220\n And you have the freedom to do that\n\n1:08:14.220 --> 1:08:17.380\n because there's a lot of space on all sides.\n\n1:08:17.380 --> 1:08:18.700\n Yes, okay, so that helps.\n\n1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:20.620\n So again, maybe some time.\n\n1:08:22.360 --> 1:08:24.620\n I do agree with that new hope\n\n1:08:24.620 --> 1:08:27.140\n that's kind of built into human beings of like,\n\n1:08:27.140 --> 1:08:29.540\n let's go to America, let's go to the utopia.\n\n1:08:29.540 --> 1:08:30.660\n We even have it with space.\n\n1:08:30.660 --> 1:08:32.100\n Let's go to Mars.\n\n1:08:32.100 --> 1:08:33.240\n We gotta see what's over there.\n\n1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:37.260\n And it's just red, dusty bullshit, but you still gotta go.\n\n1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:40.380\n So I'm with you on that about this new hope, this new land.\n\n1:08:41.260 --> 1:08:42.740\n And I think that is beautiful.\n\n1:08:42.740 --> 1:08:43.940\n And I think there's a lot of haters.\n\n1:08:43.940 --> 1:08:46.940\n I think there's a lot of naysayers who hate change,\n\n1:08:46.940 --> 1:08:48.260\n who hate anything new.\n\n1:08:48.260 --> 1:08:50.940\n And then I think you gotta go, hey, that hurts, that sucks,\n\n1:08:50.940 --> 1:08:53.000\n but blow me dickless.\n\n1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.020\n I'm trying something.\n\n1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:55.340\n You're a loser.\n\n1:08:55.340 --> 1:08:57.060\n Stop hating on me.\n\n1:08:57.060 --> 1:08:59.280\n I mean, how many people hate Elon Musk?\n\n1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:00.580\n Yeah, it's hilarious.\n\n1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:03.620\n I mean, there's some of the criticism on Austin.\n\n1:09:03.620 --> 1:09:04.860\n It's like a fad.\n\n1:09:04.860 --> 1:09:07.820\n Like a lot of people are really, people are excited\n\n1:09:07.820 --> 1:09:10.740\n about Austin and somehow that's like,\n\n1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:12.560\n it's like when Green Day became famous,\n\n1:09:12.560 --> 1:09:15.280\n you no longer want to be a fan of Green Day.\n\n1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:17.340\n But to me, like that's...\n\n1:09:17.340 --> 1:09:18.940\n Well, Austin was already a cool town.\n\n1:09:18.940 --> 1:09:21.340\n Like every comic five years ago, it's like,\n\n1:09:21.340 --> 1:09:23.920\n oh, I got Austin this weekend, I can't wait.\n\n1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:25.340\n So it already had a buzz,\n\n1:09:25.340 --> 1:09:29.380\n but some people think maybe the buzz was the cool part.\n\n1:09:29.380 --> 1:09:33.100\n The fact that it was like this off the beaten path city\n\n1:09:33.100 --> 1:09:35.580\n and now I get to visit it and then leave.\n\n1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:37.380\n But I think it could still be\n\n1:09:37.380 --> 1:09:40.340\n this comedy tech booming place.\n\n1:09:40.340 --> 1:09:43.240\n It just will take some time and people want it right now.\n\n1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:46.980\n Well, on the tech side, it's...\n\n1:09:46.980 --> 1:09:47.820\n It's already there?\n\n1:09:47.820 --> 1:09:50.160\n It's getting there very fast.\n\n1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:53.780\n So, I mean, Elon's really pushing that with the factory.\n\n1:09:53.780 --> 1:09:58.520\n It's just a huge number of people are moving there with jobs.\n\n1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:00.300\n Like you're already starting.\n\n1:10:00.300 --> 1:10:03.000\n And then the opportunities to launch new companies\n\n1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:04.060\n is just incredible.\n\n1:10:04.060 --> 1:10:05.820\n I guess it's not right now.\n\n1:10:05.820 --> 1:10:09.160\n It's like within months, within a year, that kind of thing.\n\n1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:11.620\n But like, it's an opportunity to just\n\n1:10:11.620 --> 1:10:14.440\n start to build shit in a new place.\n\n1:10:14.440 --> 1:10:15.280\n And it's cool.\n\n1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:17.180\n It's kind of like going to Mars.\n\n1:10:17.180 --> 1:10:18.580\n It's like you get to start over.\n\n1:10:18.580 --> 1:10:20.780\n Yeah, and I like the hope aspect.\n\n1:10:20.780 --> 1:10:22.720\n I think that's huge for people.\n\n1:10:22.720 --> 1:10:25.380\n And I'm all for it.\n\n1:10:25.380 --> 1:10:26.340\n I hope it works out.\n\n1:10:26.340 --> 1:10:27.460\n I don't know if it will,\n\n1:10:27.460 --> 1:10:29.620\n but I don't know anything about economies\n\n1:10:29.620 --> 1:10:32.100\n and city planning and all that shit.\n\n1:10:32.100 --> 1:10:35.980\n So it might be too early to say, but I hope it works.\n\n1:10:35.980 --> 1:10:37.860\n Are you still talking about Austin or Mars?\n\n1:10:37.860 --> 1:10:38.700\n Austin.\n\n1:10:38.700 --> 1:10:41.620\n Mars is, eh, there's nothing there.\n\n1:10:41.620 --> 1:10:42.900\n There's no vagina there.\n\n1:10:42.900 --> 1:10:44.140\n There's no food there.\n\n1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:45.040\n There's no water there.\n\n1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:45.880\n I don't know.\n\n1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:48.180\n It seems, I get space travel.\n\n1:10:48.180 --> 1:10:49.100\n I think it's important.\n\n1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:53.560\n But I don't know Mars is really gonna move the needle.\n\n1:10:55.860 --> 1:10:59.700\n So what are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX\n\n1:10:59.700 --> 1:11:01.580\n and launching rockets into space?\n\n1:11:01.580 --> 1:11:04.260\n I think it's all good because you could say,\n\n1:11:04.260 --> 1:11:05.660\n hey, we could just feed everybody.\n\n1:11:05.660 --> 1:11:07.260\n And I was like, yeah, that's true.\n\n1:11:07.260 --> 1:11:08.660\n By the way, these guys give a ton of money\n\n1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:11.820\n to philanthropy shit that nobody cares about.\n\n1:11:11.820 --> 1:11:13.100\n By the way, it's weird.\n\n1:11:13.100 --> 1:11:17.780\n He could feed Nigeria with pocket change of his.\n\n1:11:17.780 --> 1:11:20.180\n And you're like, well, maybe he has.\n\n1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:21.820\n I heard Bill Gates gave back so much money\n\n1:11:21.820 --> 1:11:23.420\n he saved 6 million lives.\n\n1:11:23.420 --> 1:11:26.220\n But that's a reverse Holocaust, by the way.\n\n1:11:26.220 --> 1:11:27.320\n That's pretty good.\n\n1:11:27.320 --> 1:11:28.160\n What have you done?\n\n1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:29.260\n You're a barista.\n\n1:11:29.260 --> 1:11:34.260\n So I just think space travel is good\n\n1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:37.820\n because you learn about the place you're living in\n\n1:11:37.820 --> 1:11:39.780\n from going to space.\n\n1:11:39.780 --> 1:11:42.740\n It kind of helps you learn about this more.\n\n1:11:42.740 --> 1:11:44.420\n You could say, what's the point of going to this other there?\n\n1:11:44.420 --> 1:11:46.660\n But it does help, I think.\n\n1:11:46.660 --> 1:11:49.900\n Yeah, doing difficult things in the engineering space\n\n1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:54.700\n seems to be a way to develop as almost like an accident,\n\n1:11:54.700 --> 1:11:57.140\n as a side effect of doing a really difficult thing\n\n1:11:57.140 --> 1:11:58.720\n in a team of brilliant people.\n\n1:11:58.720 --> 1:12:01.060\n You develop things like the internet.\n\n1:12:01.060 --> 1:12:02.620\n And you could argue that the internet\n\n1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:04.180\n maybe is not so good for society.\n\n1:12:04.180 --> 1:12:05.060\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n1:12:05.060 --> 1:12:06.060\n It's good and bad.\n\n1:12:06.060 --> 1:12:06.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:06.900 --> 1:12:07.980\n But it's like a pull up.\n\n1:12:07.980 --> 1:12:09.240\n You're trying to get your bicep going,\n\n1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:12.140\n but hey, before you know it, you got decent forearms.\n\n1:12:12.140 --> 1:12:13.460\n But you weren't working on the forearms,\n\n1:12:13.460 --> 1:12:15.820\n you wanted to buy, but you got the fore.\n\n1:12:15.820 --> 1:12:18.600\n And I think that's kind of what space travel is.\n\n1:12:18.600 --> 1:12:22.420\n I like how this pivoted into a workout routine advice.\n\n1:12:22.420 --> 1:12:25.060\n I'm trying to get an analogy going here.\n\n1:12:25.060 --> 1:12:26.500\n All right, they work pretty well.\n\n1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:27.340\n I'll take it.\n\n1:12:27.340 --> 1:12:28.180\n All right.\n\n1:12:28.180 --> 1:12:32.300\n What are your thoughts about, since I'm a robotics person,\n\n1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:37.300\n I'd be curious to see, do you think about the space at all?\n\n1:12:37.900 --> 1:12:39.780\n About, first of all, autonomous vehicles\n\n1:12:39.780 --> 1:12:44.780\n with Tesla Autopilot and Waymo self driving car.\n\n1:12:45.260 --> 1:12:46.300\n I'm not sure if you're familiar\n\n1:12:46.300 --> 1:12:48.700\n with all the autonomous vehicles and so on.\n\n1:12:48.700 --> 1:12:51.020\n So those are robots on wheels.\n\n1:12:51.020 --> 1:12:52.920\n And then there's also legged robots.\n\n1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:54.860\n So next time you're in Austin,\n\n1:12:54.860 --> 1:12:56.500\n you get to meet some of the legged robots.\n\n1:12:56.500 --> 1:13:00.300\n That's what I've been working on.\n\n1:13:00.300 --> 1:13:04.700\n And I find those kind of a fascinating way\n\n1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:09.700\n to explore the nature of intelligence in our computers,\n\n1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:13.580\n but also explore our own intelligence\n\n1:13:13.580 --> 1:13:15.300\n and also explore our own,\n\n1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:20.860\n like what makes us connect to other living beings,\n\n1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:24.020\n whether it's dogs, cats, or other humans.\n\n1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:26.100\n Like there's some magic there\n\n1:13:26.100 --> 1:13:27.980\n that's beyond just intelligence.\n\n1:13:27.980 --> 1:13:30.460\n And I, like when I have the robot dog,\n\n1:13:30.460 --> 1:13:34.500\n there's some aspect to it that, I don't know,\n\n1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:37.100\n brings me joy in a way that a dog does,\n\n1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:38.400\n in a way that a good friend does.\n\n1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:39.740\n Yeah, that's interesting.\n\n1:13:39.740 --> 1:13:43.420\n And I'm not sure if that's some kind of anthropomorphism,\n\n1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:47.400\n like where I'm projecting my hopes for this,\n\n1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:50.940\n what this thing is, but it's kind of built in.\n\n1:13:50.940 --> 1:13:52.620\n I mean, it's just a source of joy.\n\n1:13:52.620 --> 1:13:54.460\n Maybe it's connected to the fact\n\n1:13:54.460 --> 1:13:56.460\n that there's just like a loneliness\n\n1:13:56.460 --> 1:13:58.660\n within all of us, within me.\n\n1:13:58.660 --> 1:14:03.340\n And it's just nice to have other things in your life\n\n1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:05.860\n that move, that recognize you, that kind of thing.\n\n1:14:05.860 --> 1:14:09.140\n I mean, I suppose it's nice to even just have a plant.\n\n1:14:09.140 --> 1:14:10.140\n Yeah, it is.\n\n1:14:10.140 --> 1:14:10.980\n Plant goes a long way.\n\n1:14:10.980 --> 1:14:12.460\n You see a guy with plants in his apartment,\n\n1:14:12.460 --> 1:14:14.260\n it changes the apartment because they're alive.\n\n1:14:14.260 --> 1:14:15.100\n You gotta water them.\n\n1:14:15.100 --> 1:14:15.980\n You gotta put sun on them.\n\n1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:17.580\n So yeah, I think there's something there.\n\n1:14:17.580 --> 1:14:19.720\n And I think you can see people's reactions\n\n1:14:19.720 --> 1:14:22.580\n when you show them advanced technology,\n\n1:14:22.580 --> 1:14:25.740\n like these dog robots or these robots that dance and shit.\n\n1:14:25.740 --> 1:14:27.700\n People are like, what the fuck?\n\n1:14:27.700 --> 1:14:30.220\n Like it hits home in some way, whether it's fear\n\n1:14:30.220 --> 1:14:33.800\n or you wanna fuck them clearly, whatever it is,\n\n1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:36.460\n but it does connect with you in some way.\n\n1:14:36.460 --> 1:14:38.480\n So I'm with you.\n\n1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:41.000\n And I think this is why I don't think robots will take over.\n\n1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.820\n You always hear that robot, they're making them too advanced.\n\n1:14:42.820 --> 1:14:45.900\n They're gonna wipe us out, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:14:45.900 --> 1:14:50.260\n If robots get at human emotions, that is scary\n\n1:14:50.260 --> 1:14:52.140\n because they could get mad at us and kill us\n\n1:14:52.140 --> 1:14:53.520\n and they're stronger and they don't need sleep.\n\n1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:54.360\n They don't need food.\n\n1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:55.680\n They don't need water.\n\n1:14:55.680 --> 1:14:56.940\n They don't get jealous.\n\n1:14:56.940 --> 1:14:59.360\n But if they have emotions,\n\n1:14:59.360 --> 1:15:01.360\n then I think we can dominate them\n\n1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:04.220\n because who knows emotions better than us?\n\n1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:05.780\n We've got thousands of years\n\n1:15:05.780 --> 1:15:08.260\n of evolutionary emotional bullshit.\n\n1:15:08.260 --> 1:15:10.260\n We can go, hey robot, I heard your wife\n\n1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:12.260\n fucked that black and Decker, huh?\n\n1:15:12.260 --> 1:15:13.800\n They're gonna crumble.\n\n1:15:13.800 --> 1:15:15.260\n We can bully them.\n\n1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:16.820\n Emotionally manipulate robots.\n\n1:15:16.820 --> 1:15:18.600\n Yes, that's when we'll win.\n\n1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:21.220\n Right now, they could kill us.\n\n1:15:21.220 --> 1:15:23.060\n They could just, we'd all die.\n\n1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:24.860\n Then we shoot them back, bing, bing, bing, bing.\n\n1:15:24.860 --> 1:15:25.820\n That's no good.\n\n1:15:25.820 --> 1:15:28.220\n But if they do get emotions, then we can go,\n\n1:15:28.220 --> 1:15:29.520\n hey, you look like hell.\n\n1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:30.600\n What is that, a rusty bolt?\n\n1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:32.800\n Hey, you're dropping some oil there, you loser.\n\n1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:35.300\n I think we can win if they do get emotions.\n\n1:15:35.300 --> 1:15:37.300\n This goes back to your father being able\n\n1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:39.620\n to undercut you with a single word.\n\n1:15:39.620 --> 1:15:40.460\n You're right.\n\n1:15:40.460 --> 1:15:42.260\n Yeah, so we're the creators of the robots\n\n1:15:42.260 --> 1:15:43.580\n and then the robots will just,\n\n1:15:43.580 --> 1:15:46.620\n you would say the exact thing\n\n1:15:46.620 --> 1:15:49.300\n where the robot would be like, that son of a bitch.\n\n1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.340\n And then it goes back to his hole\n\n1:15:51.340 --> 1:15:52.980\n and just sits there miserable.\n\n1:15:52.980 --> 1:15:55.900\n Right, yeah, hardware looks more like software to me.\n\n1:15:55.900 --> 1:15:59.080\n You can't get it up, yada, yada, yada.\n\n1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:00.300\n But I'm not worried about robots\n\n1:16:00.300 --> 1:16:01.900\n and I think self, what do you think\n\n1:16:01.900 --> 1:16:03.260\n about the self driving cars?\n\n1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:06.500\n Is that just wiping out the horse and buggy?\n\n1:16:06.500 --> 1:16:09.340\n Isn't that just progression of technology?\n\n1:16:09.340 --> 1:16:11.780\n Yeah, so I don't know if you've driven in a Tesla,\n\n1:16:11.780 --> 1:16:12.620\n for example.\n\n1:16:12.620 --> 1:16:16.140\n I have, I rode in the passenger, I just drive it.\n\n1:16:16.140 --> 1:16:18.180\n Yeah, there's several stages in that.\n\n1:16:18.180 --> 1:16:20.860\n I think it's the problem is way harder than people realize.\n\n1:16:20.860 --> 1:16:22.380\n And for quite a while,\n\n1:16:22.380 --> 1:16:24.300\n it'll just make driving more pleasant.\n\n1:16:24.300 --> 1:16:26.720\n It'll make it less stressful.\n\n1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:29.660\n It'll take over some of the boring bits for you\n\n1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:30.500\n and make it easier.\n\n1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:31.920\n Like there's something that happens actually\n\n1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:36.500\n when the car is driving for you in the following way.\n\n1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:38.800\n Like it's staying in the lane,\n\n1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:40.380\n it's keeping distance to the car in front of you.\n\n1:16:40.380 --> 1:16:42.420\n Maybe it's changing lanes.\n\n1:16:42.420 --> 1:16:44.460\n It allows you to relax a little bit.\n\n1:16:44.460 --> 1:16:48.080\n Like you become, you still have to be alert,\n\n1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:49.540\n but you become like a passenger\n\n1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:51.300\n and you get to like take in the world.\n\n1:16:51.300 --> 1:16:53.620\n I mean, somehow that's more relaxing\n\n1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:58.460\n without making you necessarily like bored more.\n\n1:16:58.460 --> 1:16:59.860\n It's energizing more.\n\n1:16:59.860 --> 1:17:01.620\n So I just think it makes the driving experience\n\n1:17:01.620 --> 1:17:02.560\n more pleasant.\n\n1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:05.220\n But when you actually fully automate cars,\n\n1:17:05.220 --> 1:17:06.660\n when you can just completely tune out\n\n1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:09.040\n and start reading a book or go to sleep,\n\n1:17:09.040 --> 1:17:13.940\n that might change society like in ways\n\n1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:15.600\n we don't even understand.\n\n1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:20.180\n Because you'll have, I mean the,\n\n1:17:20.180 --> 1:17:22.060\n it'll probably change the nature of roads\n\n1:17:22.060 --> 1:17:25.700\n because the cars, because now you can be super productive.\n\n1:17:25.700 --> 1:17:28.500\n And so no longer quite matters to you\n\n1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:31.980\n as much how long it takes to get from point A to point B\n\n1:17:31.980 --> 1:17:34.340\n because you're not wasting that time.\n\n1:17:34.340 --> 1:17:37.100\n You just continue working.\n\n1:17:37.100 --> 1:17:40.060\n It's like public transit that comes to you.\n\n1:17:40.060 --> 1:17:43.940\n And so there will be maybe less roads and bigger roads\n\n1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:46.380\n and it will just change the nature of how we get\n\n1:17:46.380 --> 1:17:47.300\n from point A to point B.\n\n1:17:47.300 --> 1:17:48.140\n I think you're right.\n\n1:17:48.140 --> 1:17:50.380\n But then couple that also with the fact\n\n1:17:50.380 --> 1:17:53.460\n that we seem to be more and more comfortable\n\n1:17:53.460 --> 1:17:55.180\n existing in the digital world.\n\n1:17:55.180 --> 1:17:56.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:56.020 --> 1:17:59.100\n So like maybe we won't want to go outside more and more.\n\n1:17:59.100 --> 1:18:01.220\n We will just interact with each other virtually.\n\n1:18:01.220 --> 1:18:02.380\n And I don't mean Zoom meetings.\n\n1:18:02.380 --> 1:18:07.380\n I mean, just in other ways that's more fulfilling\n\n1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:11.780\n than a Zoom meeting, but then maybe not\n\n1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:14.380\n because like there's something deeply uncompelling\n\n1:18:15.540 --> 1:18:16.540\n about Zoom meetings.\n\n1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:18.760\n Like podcasts that are remote,\n\n1:18:19.660 --> 1:18:21.600\n unless they're super information dense,\n\n1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:24.020\n at least to me as a podcast fan, kind of suck.\n\n1:18:24.020 --> 1:18:24.860\n They suck.\n\n1:18:24.860 --> 1:18:25.680\n There's no connection.\n\n1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:26.980\n It goes back to the dog thing.\n\n1:18:26.980 --> 1:18:28.900\n With the Zoom, there's no connection.\n\n1:18:28.900 --> 1:18:29.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:29.740 --> 1:18:31.460\n And we're not, you know, I don't understand why\n\n1:18:31.460 --> 1:18:32.780\n we're not even making eye contact.\n\n1:18:32.780 --> 1:18:33.760\n I know.\n\n1:18:33.760 --> 1:18:34.740\n But it's something there.\n\n1:18:34.740 --> 1:18:35.580\n It's in the room.\n\n1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:36.420\n There's pheromones.\n\n1:18:36.420 --> 1:18:39.100\n And that's like out of our understanding probably.\n\n1:18:39.100 --> 1:18:41.480\n It's just some kind of weird biological,\n\n1:18:41.480 --> 1:18:43.540\n you know, you ever have Cheerios in a bowl?\n\n1:18:43.540 --> 1:18:47.140\n The Cheerios tend to, they tend to go together.\n\n1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:48.640\n You see a cluster of Cheerios.\n\n1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:50.280\n They're never really hanging out on the other side.\n\n1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:53.580\n And that's kind of how people are in real life.\n\n1:18:53.580 --> 1:18:55.080\n I wonder what the physics of that is.\n\n1:18:55.080 --> 1:18:57.380\n So they come together and they stick.\n\n1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:59.260\n There's so many with molecules.\n\n1:18:59.260 --> 1:19:00.340\n I don't know, I can't remember what it was,\n\n1:19:00.340 --> 1:19:01.180\n but it was fascinating.\n\n1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:02.300\n And I think that's how people are.\n\n1:19:02.300 --> 1:19:04.900\n And I think you try to write a TV show\n\n1:19:04.900 --> 1:19:09.900\n or craft a movie with your team, Zoom, nothing there.\n\n1:19:09.900 --> 1:19:10.740\n Nothing there.\n\n1:19:10.740 --> 1:19:13.880\n It's like phone sex versus penetration.\n\n1:19:14.980 --> 1:19:16.220\n One day you'll learn that.\n\n1:19:16.220 --> 1:19:18.260\n I know nothing of either of the,\n\n1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:19.100\n I look forward,\n\n1:19:19.100 --> 1:19:21.600\n because I think there's a phone sex Netflix documentary\n\n1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:23.940\n that there's a show or something like that\n\n1:19:23.940 --> 1:19:27.020\n that is really popular that I want to go watch.\n\n1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:28.980\n So at least I can learn about that.\n\n1:19:28.980 --> 1:19:29.820\n Okay.\n\n1:19:29.820 --> 1:19:31.140\n I could send you some links.\n\n1:19:31.140 --> 1:19:31.980\n Like really.\n\n1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:32.800\n Oh, on the internet?\n\n1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:33.980\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:34.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:34.820 --> 1:19:36.040\n But yeah, self driving car.\n\n1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:37.660\n I think it's just inevitable.\n\n1:19:37.660 --> 1:19:39.300\n It's coming and these truckers\n\n1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:42.100\n are going to have to figure something out.\n\n1:19:42.100 --> 1:19:42.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:42.940 --> 1:19:45.260\n I mean, that's an under understood industry actually,\n\n1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:46.280\n because there's not,\n\n1:19:47.460 --> 1:19:50.380\n there's a lot of trucking jobs and people don't want to,\n\n1:19:50.380 --> 1:19:52.460\n well, people don't want to actually take them anymore\n\n1:19:52.460 --> 1:19:53.780\n because it's such a difficult job.\n\n1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:56.160\n So it won't have,\n\n1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:58.300\n or a lot of people believe it won't have\n\n1:19:58.300 --> 1:20:01.640\n as big of a negative impact as folks anticipate.\n\n1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:02.840\n There'll be other automation.\n\n1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:04.660\n I think they'll have a huge impact.\n\n1:20:04.660 --> 1:20:06.100\n Yeah, for sure.\n\n1:20:06.100 --> 1:20:07.300\n I mean, you already see it in McDonald's.\n\n1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:08.540\n You go to the beep, beep, beep.\n\n1:20:08.540 --> 1:20:09.460\n Why do you want to get yelled at\n\n1:20:09.460 --> 1:20:11.460\n by the heavyset woman of color,\n\n1:20:11.460 --> 1:20:13.480\n you know, for making a bad order\n\n1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:16.460\n when you can just, you know, hit the screen?\n\n1:20:16.460 --> 1:20:19.100\n But those interactions I think are human.\n\n1:20:19.100 --> 1:20:20.060\n I mean, that's part of life.\n\n1:20:20.060 --> 1:20:22.260\n So it is scary taking away everything.\n\n1:20:22.260 --> 1:20:24.060\n How long till we're not fucking?\n\n1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:25.260\n That's coming too.\n\n1:20:25.260 --> 1:20:26.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:26.100 --> 1:20:27.860\n Then there's going to have two types of people.\n\n1:20:27.860 --> 1:20:29.940\n Are you a fuck in real life?\n\n1:20:29.940 --> 1:20:31.380\n Are you a digital fuck person?\n\n1:20:31.380 --> 1:20:32.220\n Oh, I'm a digital.\n\n1:20:32.220 --> 1:20:33.140\n Oh, I like real fucking.\n\n1:20:33.140 --> 1:20:34.460\n Sorry, we can't date.\n\n1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:35.540\n That's coming.\n\n1:20:35.540 --> 1:20:39.940\n Well, there's also the reproduction side of sex,\n\n1:20:39.940 --> 1:20:42.100\n which is like with genetic engineering,\n\n1:20:42.100 --> 1:20:45.980\n you'll be able to specify a little bit of details.\n\n1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:47.780\n I talked to Jamie Mertzel about that.\n\n1:20:47.780 --> 1:20:52.580\n Like where you can specify like,\n\n1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:56.380\n it'll start with like,\n\n1:20:56.380 --> 1:21:00.380\n I want my child not to have like a high likelihood\n\n1:21:00.380 --> 1:21:02.060\n of diabetes or something like that.\n\n1:21:02.060 --> 1:21:04.740\n And then you just get to specify like intelligence.\n\n1:21:04.740 --> 1:21:07.100\n You just get to specify those kinds of parameters\n\n1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:10.940\n until you're like basically trying to create a perfect human\n\n1:21:10.940 --> 1:21:12.580\n and you lose some of the magic of the flaws\n\n1:21:12.580 --> 1:21:13.740\n that make us who we are.\n\n1:21:13.740 --> 1:21:14.660\n Yes.\n\n1:21:14.660 --> 1:21:19.660\n And you know, I'm pretty sure in the full lineup of humans,\n\n1:21:19.860 --> 1:21:23.620\n like, so let me give you some information.\n\n1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:24.460\n Lay it off me, buddy.\n\n1:21:24.460 --> 1:21:26.020\n Break it down.\n\n1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:29.460\n I'm sure you researched this thoroughly,\n\n1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:33.860\n but a male of the human species,\n\n1:21:33.860 --> 1:21:38.860\n the homo sapien produces 500 billion sperm cells\n\n1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:41.620\n in a lifetime.\n\n1:21:41.620 --> 1:21:45.420\n So that's all, some more than others.\n\n1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:50.920\n That's all uniquely, genetically unique humans\n\n1:21:50.920 --> 1:21:51.760\n that you could produce.\n\n1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:54.640\n So even across those 500 billion, you can select.\n\n1:21:55.580 --> 1:21:56.420\n And so.\n\n1:21:56.420 --> 1:21:58.140\n What do you mean, like abort some or?\n\n1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:00.380\n No, you can choose which of them you want.\n\n1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:03.020\n I mean, just imagine all the genetic possibilities\n\n1:22:03.020 --> 1:22:05.020\n that are there, like all of the possible,\n\n1:22:05.020 --> 1:22:07.940\n like you won the race.\n\n1:22:07.940 --> 1:22:08.780\n Yes.\n\n1:22:09.780 --> 1:22:10.620\n Shocking.\n\n1:22:10.620 --> 1:22:11.440\n Yeah, this is the winner.\n\n1:22:11.440 --> 1:22:13.020\n Which one out of all the 500 billion?\n\n1:22:13.020 --> 1:22:15.620\n You have to imagine what the competition was.\n\n1:22:15.620 --> 1:22:18.540\n Oh, just tarts all day long.\n\n1:22:18.540 --> 1:22:19.940\n Handicap.\n\n1:22:19.940 --> 1:22:23.100\n Well, so it's not actually the fastest sperm\n\n1:22:23.100 --> 1:22:26.780\n or like it's, I think a lot of it is timing and luck.\n\n1:22:26.780 --> 1:22:27.620\n Ah.\n\n1:22:27.620 --> 1:22:28.440\n That's what it seems like.\n\n1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:29.280\n There's actual papers on this\n\n1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:30.980\n and I've actually been reading them.\n\n1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:31.940\n I hope so.\n\n1:22:31.940 --> 1:22:34.100\n So it's not just like the fastest sperm to the egg.\n\n1:22:34.100 --> 1:22:34.940\n Okay.\n\n1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:36.280\n There's a timing thing.\n\n1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:37.980\n So you were just lucky.\n\n1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:39.320\n All right.\n\n1:22:39.320 --> 1:22:40.540\n I believe that.\n\n1:22:40.540 --> 1:22:42.060\n So it's interesting to think about like,\n\n1:22:42.060 --> 1:22:46.980\n once you're able to specify some parameters\n\n1:22:46.980 --> 1:22:49.220\n of what your child is like,\n\n1:22:49.220 --> 1:22:51.460\n how that changes the nature of\n\n1:22:53.660 --> 1:22:57.780\n even just like the intimacy of two humans getting together\n\n1:22:57.780 --> 1:23:02.320\n and making, creating together a child.\n\n1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:03.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:04.640\n I mean, it changes it.\n\n1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:06.040\n It's almost like, I don't know,\n\n1:23:06.040 --> 1:23:10.740\n it becomes like a factory line of some kind.\n\n1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:12.920\n If you don't meet naturally.\n\n1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:15.320\n Yeah, if you don't meet naturally and then you don't\n\n1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:18.640\n and you get to optimize your child,\n\n1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:21.880\n then it's some like you have to consider\n\n1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:23.360\n utilitarian type of things,\n\n1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:25.480\n like what's good for society\n\n1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:28.320\n and it'll probably be regulation about what kind of children\n\n1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:29.520\n you can have or not.\n\n1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:32.200\n Like your child can not have an IQ below this\n\n1:23:32.200 --> 1:23:34.120\n or above this or something like that.\n\n1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:35.720\n Or your child can not.\n\n1:23:35.720 --> 1:23:39.200\n We already kind of do that with VIP clubs.\n\n1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:40.920\n Like, ah, you're kind of ugly\n\n1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:43.260\n or women go, hey, he's not tall enough.\n\n1:23:43.260 --> 1:23:44.480\n We kind of do it a little.\n\n1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:45.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:46.560\n Especially sexually.\n\n1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:47.380\n Yeah, we do.\n\n1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:48.680\n Can't get on the roller coaster\n\n1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:50.120\n if you're this short, whatever it is.\n\n1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:52.720\n You know, we do it in some capacity.\n\n1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:57.080\n But here, this would be like fully transparent\n\n1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:00.080\n and to a degree that it's hard to imagine.\n\n1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:02.000\n Like the way we currently do it,\n\n1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.760\n you can at least get around it.\n\n1:24:03.760 --> 1:24:04.600\n Yes.\n\n1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:07.000\n You can at least trick your way onto the roller coaster\n\n1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:08.180\n even if you're short.\n\n1:24:08.180 --> 1:24:09.020\n Right.\n\n1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:11.280\n Or the fat guy can get rich so he can get laid.\n\n1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:12.720\n You know, there's other ways.\n\n1:24:14.500 --> 1:24:16.640\n At the risk of asking the totally wrong person\n\n1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:19.600\n this question, what advice would you give\n\n1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:23.080\n to young people today in high school and college\n\n1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:26.820\n about how to have a successful career\n\n1:24:26.820 --> 1:24:28.640\n or career they're proud of\n\n1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:30.920\n or maybe have a life that they're proud of?\n\n1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:32.360\n Ooh.\n\n1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:34.280\n Well, first of all, you gotta be,\n\n1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:35.800\n you gotta want a life you're proud of.\n\n1:24:35.800 --> 1:24:38.400\n Not everybody has any integrity.\n\n1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:40.540\n A lot of people just want short money.\n\n1:24:40.540 --> 1:24:44.680\n I wanna feel good, look good right now.\n\n1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:47.360\n I wanna do Molly, boom, I'll feel good, you know?\n\n1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:50.120\n But you should space it out.\n\n1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:51.900\n You should, it's almost like saving money\n\n1:24:51.900 --> 1:24:53.200\n so you can use it later.\n\n1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:54.360\n Nobody wants to save money.\n\n1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:56.000\n What do they say, like 11% of America\n\n1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:59.320\n actually has money saved, $1,000 or some shit?\n\n1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:01.480\n It's wildly low.\n\n1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:04.280\n Everybody wants it now, now, what do you call it?\n\n1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:06.160\n Immediate gratification.\n\n1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:10.280\n I think the key to happiness and satisfaction\n\n1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:12.480\n is working for something.\n\n1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:14.920\n Even if it's, it's like a baby.\n\n1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:16.600\n If you could have a baby in five minutes,\n\n1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:18.720\n if a woman, you got a, you jizzed in her\n\n1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:21.320\n and she had a baby, oop, five minutes, boom.\n\n1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.120\n Newborn, healthy.\n\n1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:25.800\n I think you'd be more likely to throw it away\n\n1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:27.200\n if you could make it that quick.\n\n1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:30.400\n It's the fact that you spent nine months backbreaking\n\n1:25:30.400 --> 1:25:33.920\n the labor, the lactating, the ripped placenta\n\n1:25:33.920 --> 1:25:36.040\n and the hymen or whatever the fuck.\n\n1:25:36.040 --> 1:25:37.600\n That's what makes you love it.\n\n1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:38.840\n And I think it's the same with comedy\n\n1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:41.460\n or making money or whatever.\n\n1:25:41.460 --> 1:25:43.720\n Look at these kids who like child stars.\n\n1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:46.080\n They all become heroin addicts at like 22\n\n1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:48.400\n because they've just, their sensors are burned out.\n\n1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:49.480\n Their pleasure sensors.\n\n1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:51.360\n You didn't have to earn it.\n\n1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:53.720\n I think earning it is a big part of life\n\n1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:56.600\n and always try to do better, try to do more,\n\n1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.160\n try to learn new things.\n\n1:25:58.160 --> 1:25:59.560\n Hey, I'm bored.\n\n1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:00.720\n Life sucks.\n\n1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:02.600\n Play the piano then you chooch.\n\n1:26:02.600 --> 1:26:05.060\n But you won't do it because it takes effort\n\n1:26:05.060 --> 1:26:06.680\n and failure and all that.\n\n1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:08.400\n But that's the good part.\n\n1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:10.260\n And I know it's hard to see.\n\n1:26:10.260 --> 1:26:13.820\n So I think that's a good key to life\n\n1:26:13.820 --> 1:26:16.020\n is work hard at something you care about\n\n1:26:16.020 --> 1:26:18.640\n and then love the result.\n\n1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:22.760\n The hard work, the journey is actually way more important\n\n1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:23.960\n than just getting something.\n\n1:26:23.960 --> 1:26:25.400\n Everybody wants to go on Amazon.\n\n1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:26.320\n I got a package.\n\n1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:27.800\n Then you feel good for 10 seconds\n\n1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:29.800\n and all right, let's go on Amazon again.\n\n1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:31.760\n And then it's just a dumb cycle\n\n1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:35.500\n of you being disgusting and gluttonous.\n\n1:26:35.500 --> 1:26:36.960\n So work for it.\n\n1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:39.900\n Everybody wants to take steroids and just boop, I'm buff.\n\n1:26:39.900 --> 1:26:40.840\n Why'd you point at me?\n\n1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:41.660\n Well, I'm just saying.\n\n1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:42.500\n Because I'm Russian or what?\n\n1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:45.560\n Well, I saw the Icarus.\n\n1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:47.360\n But no, I'm not saying you're on roids.\n\n1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:48.840\n I'm just, you'd be way bigger.\n\n1:26:48.840 --> 1:26:52.560\n But I'm just saying, you know, work for something.\n\n1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:56.560\n And then I would also, young people eat shit early.\n\n1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:57.820\n Eat shit early.\n\n1:26:57.820 --> 1:27:00.780\n I know a guy who kind of got canceled or whatever\n\n1:27:00.780 --> 1:27:03.360\n and he had an out early, but he tried to get by\n\n1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:07.240\n and he tried to ride it and it all came crumbling down.\n\n1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:09.440\n But if he had eaten it early, like, yeah, I fucked up.\n\n1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:10.640\n I did that.\n\n1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:14.600\n Whatever it was, he would've just kind of been shit on\n\n1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.560\n for a month and then it would've gone away.\n\n1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:19.960\n But now it's his whole identity and that sucks.\n\n1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:21.080\n So eat shit early.\n\n1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:23.280\n And I know it's hard to see, what do you mean early?\n\n1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:24.560\n I'm in the present.\n\n1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:28.280\n But look ahead, look back, this time will pass.\n\n1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:29.640\n I mean, look at high school.\n\n1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:31.320\n High school was the biggest thing in our lives.\n\n1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:33.940\n Oh my God, this exam, Susie Q hates me.\n\n1:27:33.940 --> 1:27:35.360\n The football player beat me up.\n\n1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:36.640\n Oh, I'll never recover.\n\n1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:37.700\n Now you don't even think about high school.\n\n1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:40.320\n It's just a blip in your dumb life, you know?\n\n1:27:40.320 --> 1:27:41.400\n And that's what this is now.\n\n1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:42.560\n This will just be a blip.\n\n1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:46.180\n So remember that and work towards something\n\n1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:50.520\n and work hard and care about the result.\n\n1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.160\n If the result isn't good, try it again.\n\n1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:53.840\n And failure is not always bad.\n\n1:27:53.840 --> 1:27:56.720\n Failure, we look at failure as this end all, be all.\n\n1:27:56.720 --> 1:27:58.880\n My life's over, I failed.\n\n1:27:58.880 --> 1:28:01.120\n But failure is really just learning.\n\n1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:01.960\n So that's something.\n\n1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:06.720\n So in summary, eat shit early and eat shit often.\n\n1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:07.800\n Yes.\n\n1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:09.840\n All right, Mark Norman.\n\n1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:11.040\n Eat ass.\n\n1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:13.080\n That's escalated quickly.\n\n1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:16.020\n All right, I have a list of random questions for you.\n\n1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:19.500\n What activities make you lose track of time?\n\n1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:20.340\n Oh.\n\n1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:24.280\n Have that go into that zone.\n\n1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.960\n You have this happiness, contentment about you\n\n1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:28.820\n that you just truly enjoy.\n\n1:28:28.820 --> 1:28:31.240\n Yeah, I think a good conversation.\n\n1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:34.360\n Like I'll sit at the comedy cellar with friends,\n\n1:28:34.360 --> 1:28:36.700\n maybe a little whiskey's flowing.\n\n1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:38.520\n And when you're really just vibing\n\n1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:41.680\n and inhibiting.\n\n1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:42.520\n You can do it.\n\n1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:43.360\n What is it?\n\n1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:44.680\n Inhibited. Inhibited.\n\n1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:45.840\n Uninhibited. Uninhibited.\n\n1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:47.560\n When you're just vibing and you're uninhibited\n\n1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:49.520\n and you're saying crazy shit and you're laughing\n\n1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:51.480\n and you're not worried, am I seeming cool right now?\n\n1:28:51.480 --> 1:28:52.820\n Am I seeming likable?\n\n1:28:52.820 --> 1:28:56.000\n When you're just you 100% and it's all coming out of you\n\n1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.040\n and then they're saying stuff and you go back and forth\n\n1:28:58.040 --> 1:28:59.240\n and you feel that excitement.\n\n1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:00.800\n Oh, they're talking, but I wanna say my thing.\n\n1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:02.560\n And you get all peed up.\n\n1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:03.400\n I love that.\n\n1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:04.720\n And I look at my watch, I'm like, fuck,\n\n1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:05.960\n it's three in the morning.\n\n1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:07.720\n We've been talking for five hours.\n\n1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:09.040\n So I love that.\n\n1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:10.840\n That makes the time fly by.\n\n1:29:10.840 --> 1:29:13.320\n Also, I bought a, speaking of self driving cars,\n\n1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:18.320\n I bought a 1973 BMW car and it's classic\n\n1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:23.920\n and it's stick shift and it's grizzly and gritty and rusty\n\n1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:26.480\n and it's a bucket of bolts, but I love driving it.\n\n1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:27.760\n Bucket of bolts.\n\n1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:28.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:29.800\n You and Tom Waits are poets.\n\n1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:32.360\n Have you taken like a long trip anywhere,\n\n1:29:32.360 --> 1:29:35.920\n like road trip in your life or with this BMW?\n\n1:29:35.920 --> 1:29:37.600\n Not with it, it's pretty new,\n\n1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:38.440\n but I will.\n\n1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:39.760\n It's a new 97.\n\n1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:42.000\n Yeah, it's new to me.\n\n1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:45.480\n And it goes in the phase of everything we're doing now.\n\n1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:47.120\n Everything is digital, everything is automated,\n\n1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:49.960\n everything is hands off, everything is delivered.\n\n1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:52.720\n And this is the most hands on thing in the world.\n\n1:29:52.720 --> 1:29:54.160\n And I am dialed in, man.\n\n1:29:54.160 --> 1:29:56.280\n I got the tachometer, I keep an eye on that.\n\n1:29:56.280 --> 1:29:58.440\n Oh, I put the wrong gear in, shit.\n\n1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:00.920\n Oh, it's about to stall, put some gas, put some clutch.\n\n1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:05.920\n And it's all just brain power and staying in focus\n\n1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:08.680\n and all that, and it's the opposite of tweeting\n\n1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:11.800\n and texting and watching porn or whatever.\n\n1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:14.120\n So I almost needed that in my life,\n\n1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:17.840\n so I bought this car just to have this little exercise.\n\n1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:21.080\n I hope you don't mind that I'm just trying out\n\n1:30:21.080 --> 1:30:25.800\n random questions I wrote on you that are completely insane.\n\n1:30:25.800 --> 1:30:27.720\n I'm a guinea pig, jizz in my face.\n\n1:30:27.720 --> 1:30:29.080\n Bring it on, baby.\n\n1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:32.520\n This would be edited down to five minutes.\n\n1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:34.520\n If everyone on earth disappeared\n\n1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:39.520\n and it was just you left, what would your days look like?\n\n1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:40.760\n What would you do?\n\n1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:43.480\n That's tough, because I'm already an introvert\n\n1:30:43.480 --> 1:30:45.520\n and I try to avoid people mostly.\n\n1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:50.520\n Like I like a one on one, but crowds and all that is tough.\n\n1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:51.360\n So.\n\n1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:52.600\n So basically unchanged?\n\n1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:53.920\n Yeah, that's what I was gonna say,\n\n1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:56.280\n but then that's the irony is I would be so sad\n\n1:30:56.280 --> 1:30:57.200\n to not talk to anybody.\n\n1:30:57.200 --> 1:30:59.720\n So it's this weird, bittersweet thing,\n\n1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:01.960\n but I don't know what I would do, man.\n\n1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:03.960\n I guess it's kind of like when you're hung over,\n\n1:31:03.960 --> 1:31:06.920\n you just go into the primal survival mode.\n\n1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:11.920\n I gotta get food, I need water, I'm horny, jerk off.\n\n1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:15.000\n You just go, you're not like playing the piano\n\n1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.800\n or painting or at the gym.\n\n1:31:17.800 --> 1:31:21.320\n So I think I would just go into urges, man, primal urges.\n\n1:31:21.320 --> 1:31:24.800\n Find food, store food, am I safe?\n\n1:31:24.800 --> 1:31:28.800\n Make weapons, build a shelter that I can't get attacked in.\n\n1:31:28.800 --> 1:31:30.320\n I would go all survival mode.\n\n1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:33.200\n And then once I maybe realized if I was safe or not,\n\n1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:37.040\n there's no wild roaming dogs, I would start exploring.\n\n1:31:37.040 --> 1:31:42.040\n And maybe somehow get a vehicle and I would try to expand\n\n1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:43.880\n and that would be it.\n\n1:31:43.880 --> 1:31:45.200\n And maybe I'd journal.\n\n1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:49.280\n Exploring to what, to try to find new experiences?\n\n1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:51.320\n New life, if there's other,\n\n1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:53.160\n maybe there is another guy out there.\n\n1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:55.720\n Oh, so always there's a possibility.\n\n1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:56.840\n Yeah, hope.\n\n1:31:56.840 --> 1:31:57.680\n Hope.\n\n1:31:57.680 --> 1:31:58.920\n And then maybe there's a better place I could live.\n\n1:31:58.920 --> 1:32:01.080\n Let's find that and then moving on.\n\n1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:02.160\n Maybe there's more food over here.\n\n1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.480\n So yeah, the hope would drive me.\n\n1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:07.220\n But it would be bleak and sad and horrible also.\n\n1:32:07.220 --> 1:32:09.820\n So what you're saying is you really want other people\n\n1:32:09.820 --> 1:32:11.800\n to be there so you can hide from them, isn't it?\n\n1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:15.000\n Yes, yes, well said.\n\n1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.840\n All right, what's an item on your bucket list\n\n1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:19.200\n that you haven't done yet?\n\n1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:23.600\n Think about something you'd be very upset if you died\n\n1:32:23.600 --> 1:32:24.700\n and you haven't done.\n\n1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:27.240\n Well, I'm terrified of having kids,\n\n1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:28.760\n just because I'm a child myself\n\n1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:31.900\n and I'm selfish and lazy in a way.\n\n1:32:31.900 --> 1:32:34.560\n So kids are like, this is your whole life now, this is it.\n\n1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:35.880\n You gotta not let this thing die.\n\n1:32:35.880 --> 1:32:37.940\n You gotta love it, you gotta raise it.\n\n1:32:37.940 --> 1:32:39.500\n So kids scare the shit out of me,\n\n1:32:39.500 --> 1:32:43.840\n but I also feel like if I don't have them, I'll regret it.\n\n1:32:43.840 --> 1:32:46.800\n Well, you've seen so many people like you\n\n1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:48.940\n who are fundamentally changed by kids.\n\n1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:52.600\n Like it's a source, it's a source of,\n\n1:32:52.600 --> 1:32:54.160\n like a deep source of happiness,\n\n1:32:54.160 --> 1:32:55.860\n even though you didn't anticipate it.\n\n1:32:55.860 --> 1:32:57.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:57.280 --> 1:32:59.800\n So you like, you penciled it into your bucket list.\n\n1:32:59.800 --> 1:33:01.080\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:02.680\n You're, it might be on there.\n\n1:33:02.680 --> 1:33:03.640\n Okay.\n\n1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:04.520\n You want kids?\n\n1:33:04.520 --> 1:33:06.960\n Yeah, well, I want kids.\n\n1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:10.080\n I wanna get married, I wanna have kids.\n\n1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:13.920\n I kind of, I don't like choice.\n\n1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:15.640\n So in the following way,\n\n1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:18.520\n like I appreciate the value of scarcity\n\n1:33:18.520 --> 1:33:19.560\n and the power of scarcity.\n\n1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:22.160\n Like I don't like the modern dating culture.\n\n1:33:22.160 --> 1:33:23.640\n It's not some religious thing or whatever.\n\n1:33:23.640 --> 1:33:27.240\n I just like one girl for a long time\n\n1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:28.680\n or at least swinging for that always,\n\n1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:30.240\n like swinging for the fences.\n\n1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:31.720\n You could be swinging right now.\n\n1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:32.560\n I mean, you're.\n\n1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:34.000\n There's a different use of the word swinging.\n\n1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:34.840\n Sure, sure.\n\n1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:35.960\n What I'm saying, you could be clear.\n\n1:33:35.960 --> 1:33:37.620\n You look great, you're handsome.\n\n1:33:37.620 --> 1:33:38.460\n Yeah, thank you.\n\n1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:39.280\n Muscular.\n\n1:33:39.280 --> 1:33:40.120\n Thank you.\n\n1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:40.960\n You get the job done.\n\n1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:42.620\n So I feel like you wouldn't leave without an orgasm on her.\n\n1:33:42.620 --> 1:33:45.440\n Yeah, but I just like to, you know, about furries.\n\n1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:46.800\n I like to dress up as animals\n\n1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:50.040\n and I just have trouble finding others who like the same.\n\n1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:50.880\n They're up there.\n\n1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:52.320\n I could show you some chat rooms.\n\n1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:54.080\n You're also my coach for the internet.\n\n1:33:54.080 --> 1:33:54.920\n Okay.\n\n1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:59.920\n What are you most afraid of?\n\n1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:01.920\n I guess on Unlived Life.\n\n1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:07.860\n I was a big fan growing up of like wild guys, you know,\n\n1:34:07.860 --> 1:34:10.160\n like these Teddy Roosevelt's who would go out\n\n1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:14.520\n and hunt lions and like bar fighting guys.\n\n1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:17.520\n I was obsessed with the Hunter S. Thompson types.\n\n1:34:17.520 --> 1:34:21.920\n And look, this is what I love about guys like,\n\n1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:23.540\n who's a good example?\n\n1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:24.720\n Like Hemingway.\n\n1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:26.400\n Hemingway was the manliest guy.\n\n1:34:26.400 --> 1:34:28.840\n He had the rifle and the elephant gun and the whiskey\n\n1:34:28.840 --> 1:34:31.680\n and the writing and the women and the fist fights.\n\n1:34:31.680 --> 1:34:33.920\n But people forget that the other side of that coin\n\n1:34:33.920 --> 1:34:36.220\n is I'm sure he was in a lot of hotel rooms weeping.\n\n1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:37.760\n I'm sure he was lonely as fuck.\n\n1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:39.320\n I'm sure he had some wicked hangovers.\n\n1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:40.680\n I mean, he killed himself for Christ's sake.\n\n1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:42.920\n So obviously he was dealing with something.\n\n1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:46.740\n So the key to me is having this adventurous life,\n\n1:34:46.740 --> 1:34:50.240\n living to the fullest, doing crazy shit, scaring yourself,\n\n1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:52.520\n but also not killing yourself.\n\n1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:54.040\n Like also not hating,\n\n1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:56.160\n because I used to party a lot hard.\n\n1:34:56.160 --> 1:34:58.860\n I used to bang a lot of gals.\n\n1:34:58.860 --> 1:35:02.320\n And the flip side is like, this girl hates you now,\n\n1:35:02.320 --> 1:35:04.880\n or you got herpes or you're hungover,\n\n1:35:04.880 --> 1:35:06.520\n or your mom is like, where are you?\n\n1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:07.520\n You never call me anymore.\n\n1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:10.880\n You're like, oh, my mom, let ties go with my mom.\n\n1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:11.840\n I gotta connect.\n\n1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:14.720\n So there's a horrible side to the party animal.\n\n1:35:14.720 --> 1:35:18.440\n The Keith Richards we don't see is not pretty.\n\n1:35:18.440 --> 1:35:20.160\n I mean, he's already weird looking,\n\n1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:23.140\n but he's partying, he's smoking, he's living.\n\n1:35:23.140 --> 1:35:25.340\n But there's another side of that coin.\n\n1:35:25.340 --> 1:35:26.560\n And I think the key to life\n\n1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:30.000\n is living that fucking crazy, awesome, badass life,\n\n1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:34.840\n and also having some meaning\n\n1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:38.360\n and a little bit of, what's the word?\n\n1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:39.880\n Not just not killing yourself,\n\n1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:42.120\n not going sad, not being depressed.\n\n1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:45.000\n There's a medium there, a sweet spot.\n\n1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:45.940\n Does that make sense?\n\n1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:46.780\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:35:46.780 --> 1:35:51.780\n So taking big leaps and Hemingway,\n\n1:35:51.780 --> 1:35:53.080\n grabbing life by the balls,\n\n1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:54.720\n but at the same time, not crushing the balls,\n\n1:35:54.720 --> 1:35:56.520\n does that metaphor work at all?\n\n1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:59.160\n Perfect, like Evel Knievel, we all know him.\n\n1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:02.240\n What a badass, fearless, oh, man, what a cool dude.\n\n1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:03.760\n He's got balls of steel.\n\n1:36:03.760 --> 1:36:05.880\n But he also lived the back half of his life\n\n1:36:05.880 --> 1:36:08.720\n in a fucking barka lounger\n\n1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:10.160\n where his legs were made of steel\n\n1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:13.120\n and he couldn't see straight and his dick didn't work.\n\n1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:15.520\n So you know what I mean?\n\n1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:18.120\n You gotta have a balance, but you still want the balance.\n\n1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:20.840\n I'm willing to take a little bit of shit\n\n1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:23.480\n for a little bit of fun,\n\n1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:25.920\n but you don't want to go too hard.\n\n1:36:25.920 --> 1:36:27.120\n Well, you gotta still risk it.\n\n1:36:27.120 --> 1:36:30.400\n I mean, Hunter S. Thompson, it didn't end well.\n\n1:36:30.400 --> 1:36:31.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:32.160\n But it was quite a ride.\n\n1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:33.240\n Quite a ride.\n\n1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:36.840\n What small act of kindness were you once shown\n\n1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.160\n that you will never forget?\n\n1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:41.440\n Wow, that's a great question.\n\n1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:44.960\n I just wrote these for the guinea pig.\n\n1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:45.800\n You're the guinea pig.\n\n1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:46.960\n That's great, that's a keeper.\n\n1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.080\n Keep that question. Okay, that's a keeper?\n\n1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:48.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:48.920 --> 1:36:50.200\n This is where we're like workshopping questions here.\n\n1:36:50.200 --> 1:36:51.360\n All right, I'll take it.\n\n1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:52.480\n Now you're open biking.\n\n1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:53.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:54.240\n This is your version.\n\n1:36:55.240 --> 1:36:57.560\n Let's see, there's a couple ladies in high school\n\n1:36:57.560 --> 1:36:59.920\n who were kind enough to hand job me.\n\n1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:01.720\n That was nice, which I really appreciate.\n\n1:37:01.720 --> 1:37:04.560\n I don't think women know how much that means to us.\n\n1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:05.400\n You know, women are like,\n\n1:37:05.400 --> 1:37:06.720\n oh, I'm not a piece of meat or whatever.\n\n1:37:06.720 --> 1:37:10.000\n And you're like, I know, but if you just gave me a hand job,\n\n1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:10.840\n it would make my world.\n\n1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:13.520\n It's like telling a kid he's smart or loved.\n\n1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:15.720\n See, most people mention like a math teacher,\n\n1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:19.080\n middle school, that would inspire them to get into science.\n\n1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:21.200\n You give a shout out to the thing.\n\n1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:23.320\n Well, that's part of it, that's not the nicest,\n\n1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:25.160\n but I'm just saying that goes a long way.\n\n1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:26.120\n All right.\n\n1:37:26.120 --> 1:37:27.680\n Let's see, kindness.\n\n1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:29.200\n That's a great question.\n\n1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:32.880\n I wanna give you a good answer.\n\n1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:35.080\n I got lost when I was like six.\n\n1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:38.720\n I was walking around my dad and I zoned out and went away.\n\n1:37:38.720 --> 1:37:41.520\n And next thing you know, I don't know where I am.\n\n1:37:41.520 --> 1:37:42.400\n I'm in a neighborhood.\n\n1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:45.920\n This old guy finds me crying on a lawn somewhere\n\n1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:47.880\n and he goes, come inside.\n\n1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:50.880\n And he tried to call my parents and nothing came of it.\n\n1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:53.680\n Eventually they found me after like nine hours,\n\n1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:57.960\n cops were there, the FBI is out there, fucking helicopters.\n\n1:37:57.960 --> 1:37:59.200\n And I guess, you know, that's nice.\n\n1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:01.320\n This old guy took me in for a couple of hours\n\n1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:05.280\n and just sat me down and kept me safe.\n\n1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:06.160\n That's something.\n\n1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:07.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:08.280\n Oh, how about Enis?\n\n1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:12.360\n My transvestite nanny, very kind.\n\n1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:15.400\n He, did you hear about this?\n\n1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:16.240\n No.\n\n1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:19.240\n We had this transvestite nanny who was like a drag queen,\n\n1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:20.080\n but it was in the 90s.\n\n1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:20.920\n So it was weird.\n\n1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:21.880\n It was new.\n\n1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:25.680\n And my bike got stolen and he, you know,\n\n1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:27.000\n my parents were like, eh, what are you gonna do?\n\n1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.760\n They're poor kids, you know?\n\n1:38:28.760 --> 1:38:31.160\n And he was like, fuck it, we're gonna go get that bike.\n\n1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:33.840\n And I was like, this guy's in a wig and high heels,\n\n1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:35.000\n big black guy.\n\n1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:38.200\n And I'm like, ah, what are you gonna do?\n\n1:38:38.200 --> 1:38:39.040\n You know, it's gone.\n\n1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:40.360\n And he's like, nah, we're gonna go get it.\n\n1:38:40.360 --> 1:38:44.040\n So we got in the van and drove around my neighborhood,\n\n1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:46.240\n saw the kids, fuck with the bike, you know,\n\n1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:48.120\n five street tufts.\n\n1:38:48.120 --> 1:38:51.040\n And he goes, all right, you want to come out\n\n1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:52.040\n or should I just do this?\n\n1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:53.120\n And I was like, you do it.\n\n1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:53.960\n I'm terrified.\n\n1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:55.000\n What are you, crazy?\n\n1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.760\n And he got out of the van in full, you know,\n\n1:38:58.760 --> 1:38:59.960\n heels and wig.\n\n1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:01.920\n And he went up to these guys and they went off.\n\n1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:03.600\n Oh my God, look at this fucking guy,\n\n1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:05.160\n homo faggot, all this shit.\n\n1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:06.560\n You know, it's the 90s.\n\n1:39:06.560 --> 1:39:09.600\n And he just stared at them long enough\n\n1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:10.960\n to where they were kind of like, all right,\n\n1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:12.680\n well, I guess we're gonna fight you now.\n\n1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:14.920\n And he goes, that's not your bike.\n\n1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:16.560\n And they go, what are you gonna do about it?\n\n1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:18.800\n And he puts his hand on the middle of the bike\n\n1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:19.840\n and they didn't do anything.\n\n1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:22.480\n And he just picked it up and said, that's what I thought.\n\n1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:25.320\n Put the bike over his shoulder, slid the van door open,\n\n1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:27.160\n threw the bike in and we drove off.\n\n1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:29.600\n Somebody stuck up for you.\n\n1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:31.600\n Yeah, and you know, I mean, he could have got,\n\n1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:33.080\n I mean, they had tools.\n\n1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:35.880\n They could have fucking tuned him up, two seconds.\n\n1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:39.000\n That actually like takes courage.\n\n1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.240\n Oh yeah, real courage.\n\n1:39:41.240 --> 1:39:45.040\n And then that, the reason you do an act like that\n\n1:39:45.040 --> 1:39:48.760\n is that makes a kid like you feel like\n\n1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:51.200\n there's somebody on your side, that's powerful.\n\n1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:52.760\n Someone on your side is big.\n\n1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:53.600\n Is big.\n\n1:39:53.600 --> 1:39:54.860\n That goes a long way.\n\n1:39:56.400 --> 1:39:57.840\n Especially when they have the risk\n\n1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:00.080\n of getting their ass kicked or their job taken away\n\n1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:01.040\n or whatever it is.\n\n1:40:01.960 --> 1:40:05.400\n Now we're gonna get philosophical,\n\n1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:07.560\n maybe a little bit emotional.\n\n1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:12.560\n Oh, would you rather lose all your old memories\n\n1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:15.100\n or never be able to make new ones?\n\n1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:22.840\n It's a tough one, but I'd go easy answer, make new ones.\n\n1:40:22.840 --> 1:40:24.600\n But don't you think all the shitty things\n\n1:40:24.600 --> 1:40:25.960\n that happen to you?\n\n1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:27.720\n Oh, so my hard drive is wiped clean.\n\n1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:30.280\n It's not, is it memories\n\n1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:34.200\n or is it how every memory affected me too?\n\n1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:35.720\n I mean, this is a very.\n\n1:40:35.720 --> 1:40:36.840\n Or do they go hand in hand?\n\n1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:39.400\n I think the reality about memories\n\n1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:40.740\n is you replay them often.\n\n1:40:40.740 --> 1:40:43.560\n You go back to them even when you're not aware of it.\n\n1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:45.880\n You really go, you go back often like that.\n\n1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:47.600\n And they change.\n\n1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:48.420\n You change them too.\n\n1:40:48.420 --> 1:40:51.480\n Yeah, you change them to suit your understanding\n\n1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:52.320\n of the world.\n\n1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:53.140\n Yes.\n\n1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:57.420\n And so the dark view you have,\n\n1:40:57.420 --> 1:40:59.840\n both the hope and the cynicism you have about the world\n\n1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:04.300\n is so deeply grounded in the memories\n\n1:41:04.300 --> 1:41:05.800\n that you're basically, I would say,\n\n1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:07.400\n if you erase all memories,\n\n1:41:08.600 --> 1:41:10.840\n I think you're really starting over\n\n1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:14.800\n with maybe the wisdom of how the world works,\n\n1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:18.460\n but not so much of your personality is gone.\n\n1:41:18.460 --> 1:41:19.680\n You would really,\n\n1:41:21.860 --> 1:41:23.840\n it'd be interesting how your comedy would change.\n\n1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:25.540\n Maybe you would have a good sense of timing.\n\n1:41:25.540 --> 1:41:30.540\n You have a good sense of the writing process maybe.\n\n1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:33.240\n But like.\n\n1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:34.440\n Now you're making some good points,\n\n1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:35.280\n but let me ask you this.\n\n1:41:35.280 --> 1:41:37.780\n Let's say I go to Lake Cuomo with my girlfriend.\n\n1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:43.000\n Now, like I wipe the memory or I keep my old memories.\n\n1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.620\n Let's say I go to the Tuscany with the lady.\n\n1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:48.040\n I just won't remember that?\n\n1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:50.000\n Yeah, but you get to experience it in the moment.\n\n1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:50.840\n Okay.\n\n1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:51.660\n You'll get to enjoy it.\n\n1:41:51.660 --> 1:41:53.000\n Can I look at a photo of it?\n\n1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:55.840\n Yes.\n\n1:41:55.840 --> 1:41:56.880\n But I would, what the hell is this?\n\n1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:57.720\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:41:57.720 --> 1:41:59.960\n Oh, fascinating.\n\n1:41:59.960 --> 1:42:00.800\n It's exact.\n\n1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:01.960\n The rules are pretty simple.\n\n1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:02.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:04.300\n I think everyone knows how the rules go.\n\n1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:06.640\n So you would, yeah, so what?\n\n1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:08.540\n Well, I was gonna say start new ones,\n\n1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:11.360\n but then I realized I wouldn't be who I was without them.\n\n1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:12.200\n That's what you're saying.\n\n1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:14.040\n So I guess I'd keep them.\n\n1:42:14.040 --> 1:42:17.800\n Cause I am 38, so I've gotten a good chunk out of life.\n\n1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:18.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:20.940\n And let's be honest, how many years do you have left?\n\n1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:21.780\n I know, right?\n\n1:42:21.780 --> 1:42:22.620\n I got AIDS.\n\n1:42:23.780 --> 1:42:25.420\n Is it better to have loved,\n\n1:42:25.420 --> 1:42:26.960\n okay, this question is ridiculous.\n\n1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:29.120\n Is it better to have loved than lost\n\n1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:31.320\n or to have never loved at all?\n\n1:42:31.320 --> 1:42:34.560\n It sounds cliche, but there's a question.\n\n1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:35.860\n Definitely better to loss.\n\n1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:38.440\n So you enjoy the ups and downs.\n\n1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:40.760\n Yeah, that's life.\n\n1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:42.300\n We're sun and rain, baby.\n\n1:42:44.020 --> 1:42:45.720\n I kind of like both, the whole thing.\n\n1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:49.140\n The loss, every time you lose something,\n\n1:42:49.140 --> 1:42:52.800\n it really makes you distinctly realize\n\n1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:54.240\n how much you valued it.\n\n1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:55.080\n Yes.\n\n1:42:55.080 --> 1:43:02.080\n Like when I'm feeling alone and I'm sitting there alone\n\n1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:06.720\n at home and I wish I could hang out with somebody,\n\n1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.560\n that's like a realization how awesome people are.\n\n1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:11.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:11.680 --> 1:43:15.560\n So it's like the missing, yeah.\n\n1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:17.320\n We don't have a lot of that in life anymore\n\n1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:19.360\n because we can have anything we want immediately.\n\n1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:20.720\n So the missing has gone away,\n\n1:43:20.720 --> 1:43:25.280\n which again drives down the joy of having it.\n\n1:43:25.280 --> 1:43:28.480\n So I think you're right, you need both.\n\n1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:32.800\n So like you said, you have a terminal condition,\n\n1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:34.340\n not many years left.\n\n1:43:34.340 --> 1:43:35.680\n Do you think about your mortality?\n\n1:43:35.680 --> 1:43:37.760\n You think about that?\n\n1:43:37.760 --> 1:43:38.720\n All day, every day.\n\n1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:39.560\n Are you afraid?\n\n1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:42.400\n Not afraid, because it's inevitable.\n\n1:43:42.400 --> 1:43:45.480\n So it's more like, how are we gonna handle this?\n\n1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:47.720\n It's like the winter is coming,\n\n1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:50.240\n let's stock up on some fucking nuts.\n\n1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:51.640\n But the existential nature of it,\n\n1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:53.480\n like the fact that this ride ends,\n\n1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:55.440\n like what the hell are you doing any of this for?\n\n1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:56.520\n Like, is it your?\n\n1:43:56.520 --> 1:43:58.560\n Satisfaction, happiness.\n\n1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:02.480\n Short term, but like there is a presumption there\n\n1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:04.360\n that it kind of goes on forever.\n\n1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:07.300\n I think if you truly think about the fact that it ends.\n\n1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:10.800\n Your brain almost shuts it down.\n\n1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:14.280\n Yeah, there's some kind of like protective like switch\n\n1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:15.380\n that just goes off.\n\n1:44:15.380 --> 1:44:19.320\n I mean, that's why the Stoics encourage people\n\n1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:20.640\n to meditate on death,\n\n1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:24.080\n because it somehow reorganizes your priorities.\n\n1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:26.200\n It helps you like, holy shit,\n\n1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:28.840\n this ends, make the most of the day.\n\n1:44:28.840 --> 1:44:29.960\n It's just a nice thing,\n\n1:44:29.960 --> 1:44:33.200\n but still you can't quite comprehend that the thing ends.\n\n1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:35.240\n Little things too.\n\n1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:38.660\n People go like, oh, we got a layover between our flights.\n\n1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:40.400\n It's an hour, what are we gonna do for an hour?\n\n1:44:40.400 --> 1:44:41.360\n It's like, what do you mean,\n\n1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:42.520\n what are you gonna do for an hour?\n\n1:44:42.520 --> 1:44:44.240\n You're gonna kill an hour.\n\n1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:46.320\n How are we gonna kill this hour?\n\n1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:47.360\n This is part of your life.\n\n1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:48.200\n You're just trying to get rid of it,\n\n1:44:48.200 --> 1:44:49.160\n you're just trying to kill it.\n\n1:44:49.160 --> 1:44:50.200\n That always blew my mind.\n\n1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:52.840\n Like, hey, fuck it, let's go hit the airport bar.\n\n1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:57.140\n Let's get a candy bar or something, anything with bar.\n\n1:44:57.140 --> 1:45:00.480\n But it's just, you've gotta live.\n\n1:45:00.480 --> 1:45:01.960\n I hate this like, how are we gonna burn?\n\n1:45:01.960 --> 1:45:04.160\n Oh, the bar didn't open for 15 minutes.\n\n1:45:04.160 --> 1:45:05.000\n What are we gonna do?\n\n1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.320\n Well, we got 15 minutes.\n\n1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:07.600\n The world is our oyster.\n\n1:45:07.600 --> 1:45:09.160\n Yeah, make the most of it.\n\n1:45:09.160 --> 1:45:11.880\n And like you said, in modern day,\n\n1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:13.740\n actually the boredom is a gift.\n\n1:45:13.740 --> 1:45:18.460\n Like when you're waiting for something, that's a gift.\n\n1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:20.400\n You get to be with your thoughts.\n\n1:45:20.400 --> 1:45:21.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:22.760\n Those are the same thoughts you'll have\n\n1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:24.400\n when you're on your deathbed.\n\n1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:28.680\n There won't be a, you won't be scrolling TikTok\n\n1:45:28.680 --> 1:45:29.700\n on your deathbed.\n\n1:45:29.700 --> 1:45:30.760\n I hope not, Jesus.\n\n1:45:30.760 --> 1:45:33.200\n You'd be a lot more, actually maybe you would be.\n\n1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:34.160\n What a sad existence.\n\n1:45:34.160 --> 1:45:35.920\n Because it would be a good,\n\n1:45:35.920 --> 1:45:37.440\n like content creators would be like,\n\n1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:39.360\n ooh, I'm dying, this would be good content.\n\n1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:42.080\n Yeah, I wanna be able to sure,\n\n1:45:42.080 --> 1:45:44.440\n film the exact moment it goes, beep.\n\n1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:47.440\n Like last words, I wonder what my last words will be.\n\n1:45:47.440 --> 1:45:50.920\n It'd be a good way to like end the account with a bang.\n\n1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:52.360\n Yep, I like that.\n\n1:45:52.360 --> 1:45:53.620\n Well, you know that you ever seen that meme\n\n1:45:53.620 --> 1:45:54.700\n where the old guy in bed, he goes,\n\n1:45:54.700 --> 1:45:58.520\n I wish I had tweeted more, you know, and then he dies.\n\n1:45:58.520 --> 1:45:59.480\n It's so true.\n\n1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:00.700\n Could be the future.\n\n1:46:00.700 --> 1:46:02.800\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n1:46:04.540 --> 1:46:06.100\n I don't think there is one.\n\n1:46:06.100 --> 1:46:07.840\n Everybody always throws that out there.\n\n1:46:07.840 --> 1:46:08.680\n There isn't a meaning.\n\n1:46:08.680 --> 1:46:11.120\n I think we're here, we're lucky to be here.\n\n1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:13.040\n I think there's no afterlife, there's no heaven.\n\n1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:16.080\n That's all shit we tell ourselves to feel better.\n\n1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:18.520\n And I think you gotta just, it's like saying,\n\n1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:23.280\n what is the meaning of this food I made?\n\n1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:25.100\n Well, it's just you enjoy the food,\n\n1:46:25.100 --> 1:46:26.520\n you try to get the most out of it.\n\n1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:30.080\n You built the food, you prepared it.\n\n1:46:30.080 --> 1:46:33.440\n So just get what you can out of it.\n\n1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:38.440\n Don't die and try to make it last as long as possible.\n\n1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:39.840\n Yeah, but you look at Earth,\n\n1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:42.520\n it's like 4 billion years old.\n\n1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:47.520\n And life started early on, like simple cell bacteria life,\n\n1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:49.800\n like 1 billion years in.\n\n1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:51.820\n And then it started like having lots\n\n1:46:51.820 --> 1:46:54.800\n of aggressive interaction.\n\n1:46:54.800 --> 1:46:57.280\n Eventually there's predator and prey and there's sex,\n\n1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:00.200\n lots of sex, lots of sex, lots of violence.\n\n1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:01.440\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:03.760\n And then, you know, through natural selection,\n\n1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:07.480\n there's just the whole evolutionary process of animals\n\n1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:11.240\n that have loved and lost and murdered and gotten murdered\n\n1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:12.080\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:47:12.080 --> 1:47:14.400\n And it's somehow led to human civilization.\n\n1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:17.120\n We're super busy trying to create things\n\n1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:19.840\n and creating beautiful art, creating beautiful comedy.\n\n1:47:21.460 --> 1:47:23.640\n Just always creating something new.\n\n1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:26.440\n It feels like it's tending towards something, like.\n\n1:47:26.440 --> 1:47:28.560\n It's not dying.\n\n1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:31.800\n If you die tomorrow, you still have all these hours of pods.\n\n1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:33.680\n So it's kind of, you think you're cheating death\n\n1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:35.680\n in a subconscious way, I think.\n\n1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:38.560\n Right, you know who Ernest Becker is and?\n\n1:47:38.560 --> 1:47:39.560\n I've heard the name.\n\n1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:42.080\n It's a book called Denial of Death,\n\n1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:46.320\n this idea that if you don't acknowledge.\n\n1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:47.320\n Books on my shelf.\n\n1:47:48.640 --> 1:47:49.480\n Girls love it.\n\n1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:51.160\n Like Dostoevsky.\n\n1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:53.400\n No, I'm just, I'm saying.\n\n1:47:53.400 --> 1:47:54.960\n You want to bring Tolstoy, Dostoevsky?\n\n1:47:54.960 --> 1:47:57.120\n Russian literature, it's back to norm.\n\n1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:58.760\n It's good to bring to,\n\n1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:02.400\n because no American has read any Russian literature,\n\n1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:04.560\n but they all appreciate it if you bring it.\n\n1:48:04.560 --> 1:48:05.840\n And it's not like they're going to ask you\n\n1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:08.000\n any legitimate questions because they haven't read it.\n\n1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.360\n So you can always pretend like you've read it, so.\n\n1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:12.280\n It's a little dense.\n\n1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:14.320\n Can we get a shortened version?\n\n1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:15.160\n Cliff notes.\n\n1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:18.360\n Yes, or make a movie with, you know, Ben Stiller\n\n1:48:18.360 --> 1:48:21.320\n that I can just go, oh, this is based on,\n\n1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:23.280\n what is it, life and death?\n\n1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:24.120\n No, what's the one?\n\n1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:24.960\n War and peace.\n\n1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:26.560\n War and peace, yeah.\n\n1:48:26.560 --> 1:48:28.760\n Yeah, so Ernest Becker's theory,\n\n1:48:28.760 --> 1:48:31.200\n and there's this whole terror management theory\n\n1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:34.480\n that basically says that like our terror of death,\n\n1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:39.040\n our fear of death is one of the central creative forces\n\n1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:40.280\n of the human condition.\n\n1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:43.240\n It's the reason we're trying to, yeah, cheat death.\n\n1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:44.880\n We're trying to dilute ourself\n\n1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:47.520\n that somehow we can become immortal through our art.\n\n1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:49.680\n That's why you've uploaded your special to YouTube\n\n1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:52.320\n because you think your special\n\n1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:54.560\n will outlive all of human civilization.\n\n1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:57.320\n You think YouTube will outlive all of human civilization.\n\n1:48:57.320 --> 1:48:58.560\n That could go away tomorrow.\n\n1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:00.240\n That can go away tomorrow.\n\n1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:01.520\n All of this can go away.\n\n1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:04.320\n So I'm truly grateful.\n\n1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:06.840\n Mr. Mark Norman, that you would spend\n\n1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:09.040\n your very valuable time with me today\n\n1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:10.480\n even though it could all go away.\n\n1:49:10.480 --> 1:49:12.520\n This could be the last day of our lives,\n\n1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:16.280\n and won't you be quite upset that this is how you spent it?\n\n1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:18.880\n Ah, yeah, in your hotel room, what am I?\n\n1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:20.160\n You're like Harvey Weinstein here.\n\n1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:22.280\n You poured me up, and now I feel fucked.\n\n1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:26.040\n Just wait, what we have ready for you\n\n1:49:26.040 --> 1:49:27.400\n after the podcast is over.\n\n1:49:28.400 --> 1:49:29.800\n All right, brother, thanks so much for talking today.\n\n1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:31.480\n Thank you, it was great.\n\n1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:32.320\n Comedy.\n\n1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:36.120\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Mark Norman.\n\n1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:37.280\n To support this podcast,\n\n1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:39.720\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:41.760\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:44.640\n from Mark Norman himself on his Twitter,\n\n1:49:44.640 --> 1:49:47.840\n which you should definitely follow because it's hilarious.\n\n1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:51.360\n The worst thing about getting Omicron for Christmas\n\n1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:53.360\n is you know it was regifted.\n\n1:49:53.360 --> 1:50:01.360\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
