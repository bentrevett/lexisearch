  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.160\n The following is a conversation with Scott Aaronson,\n\n00:03.160 --> 00:04.920\n a professor at UT Austin,\n\n00:04.920 --> 00:07.200\n director of its Quantum Information Center,\n\n00:07.200 --> 00:10.000\n and previously a professor at MIT.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:11.720\n His research interests center\n\n00:11.720 --> 00:14.580\n around the capabilities and limits of quantum computers\n\n00:14.580 --> 00:17.720\n and computational complexity theory more generally.\n\n00:17.720 --> 00:19.440\n He is an excellent writer\n\n00:19.440 --> 00:21.100\n and one of my favorite communicators\n\n00:21.100 --> 00:23.300\n of computer science in the world.\n\n00:23.300 --> 00:26.480\n We only had about an hour and a half of this conversation,\n\n00:26.480 --> 00:29.160\n so I decided to focus on quantum computing.\n\n00:29.160 --> 00:30.920\n But I can see us talking again in the future\n\n00:30.920 --> 00:33.240\n on this podcast at some point\n\n00:33.240 --> 00:35.640\n about computational complexity theory\n\n00:35.640 --> 00:38.480\n and all the complexity classes that Scott catalogs\n\n00:38.480 --> 00:41.100\n in his amazing Complexity Zoo Wiki.\n\n00:42.400 --> 00:43.640\n As a quick aside,\n\n00:43.640 --> 00:46.020\n based on questions and comments I've received,\n\n00:46.020 --> 00:48.200\n my goal with these conversations\n\n00:48.200 --> 00:51.560\n is to try to be in the background without ego\n\n00:51.560 --> 00:53.400\n and do three things.\n\n00:53.400 --> 00:55.240\n One, let the guests shine\n\n00:55.240 --> 00:56.960\n and try to discover together\n\n00:56.960 --> 00:59.080\n the most beautiful insights in their work\n\n00:59.080 --> 01:00.760\n and in their mind.\n\n01:00.760 --> 01:02.960\n Two, try to play devil's advocate\n\n01:02.960 --> 01:05.560\n just enough to provide a creative tension\n\n01:05.560 --> 01:08.040\n in exploring ideas through conversation.\n\n01:08.040 --> 01:11.760\n And three, to ask very basic questions\n\n01:11.760 --> 01:15.300\n about terminology, about concepts, about ideas.\n\n01:16.360 --> 01:18.760\n Many of the topics we talk about in the podcast\n\n01:18.760 --> 01:20.600\n I've been studying for years\n\n01:20.600 --> 01:22.800\n as a grad student, as a researcher,\n\n01:22.800 --> 01:26.180\n and generally as a curious human who loves to read.\n\n01:26.180 --> 01:29.180\n But frankly, I see myself in these conversations\n\n01:29.180 --> 01:30.360\n as the main character\n\n01:30.360 --> 01:32.720\n for one of my favorite novels by Dostoevsky\n\n01:32.720 --> 01:35.160\n called The Idiot.\n\n01:35.160 --> 01:36.920\n I enjoy playing dumb.\n\n01:36.920 --> 01:39.080\n Clearly, it comes naturally.\n\n01:39.080 --> 01:40.200\n But the basic questions\n\n01:40.200 --> 01:42.440\n don't come from my ignorance of the subject\n\n01:42.440 --> 01:45.800\n but from an instinct that the fundamentals are simple.\n\n01:45.800 --> 01:47.060\n And if we linger on them\n\n01:47.060 --> 01:49.020\n from almost a naive perspective,\n\n01:49.020 --> 01:50.920\n we can draw an insightful thread\n\n01:50.920 --> 01:53.400\n from computer science to neuroscience\n\n01:53.400 --> 01:55.320\n to physics to philosophy\n\n01:55.320 --> 01:57.920\n and to artificial intelligence.\n\n01:58.800 --> 02:01.480\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n02:01.480 --> 02:03.680\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:03.680 --> 02:05.660\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n02:05.660 --> 02:07.000\n support it on Patreon,\n\n02:07.000 --> 02:08.960\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n02:08.960 --> 02:13.540\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n02:13.540 --> 02:16.440\n As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now\n\n02:16.440 --> 02:17.880\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n02:17.880 --> 02:20.120\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n02:20.120 --> 02:21.520\n I hope that works for you\n\n02:21.520 --> 02:24.100\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n02:24.100 --> 02:25.560\n Quick summary of the ads.\n\n02:25.560 --> 02:27.080\n Two supporters today.\n\n02:27.080 --> 02:31.640\n First, get Cash App and use the code LEX PODCAST.\n\n02:31.640 --> 02:35.040\n Second, listen to the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast\n\n02:35.040 --> 02:36.300\n for tech news.\n\n02:36.300 --> 02:40.420\n Search Ride Home, two words, in your podcast app.\n\n02:41.280 --> 02:43.440\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n02:43.440 --> 02:45.860\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n02:45.860 --> 02:49.320\n When you get it, use code LEX PODCAST.\n\n02:49.320 --> 02:51.600\n Cash App lets you send money to friends,\n\n02:51.600 --> 02:54.120\n buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market\n\n02:54.120 --> 02:56.000\n with as little as one dollar.\n\n02:56.000 --> 02:59.040\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n02:59.040 --> 03:03.040\n a subsidiary of Square, a member SIPC.\n\n03:03.040 --> 03:05.360\n Since Cash App does fractional share trading,\n\n03:05.360 --> 03:08.200\n let me mention that the order execution algorithm\n\n03:08.200 --> 03:09.760\n that works behind the scenes\n\n03:09.760 --> 03:12.520\n to create the abstraction of fractional orders\n\n03:12.520 --> 03:14.640\n is an algorithmic marvel.\n\n03:14.640 --> 03:16.940\n So big props to the Cash App engineers\n\n03:16.940 --> 03:19.440\n for solving a hard problem that in the end\n\n03:19.440 --> 03:22.260\n provides an easy interface that takes a step up\n\n03:22.260 --> 03:25.140\n to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,\n\n03:25.140 --> 03:28.480\n making trading more accessible for new investors\n\n03:28.480 --> 03:31.720\n and diversification much easier.\n\n03:31.720 --> 03:34.400\n So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store\n\n03:34.400 --> 03:37.880\n or Google Play and use the code LEX PODCAST,\n\n03:37.880 --> 03:42.080\n you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n03:42.080 --> 03:44.120\n one of my favorite organizations\n\n03:44.120 --> 03:47.360\n that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education\n\n03:47.360 --> 03:49.600\n for young people around the world.\n\n03:50.560 --> 03:52.200\n This episode is also supported\n\n03:52.200 --> 03:55.720\n by the Tech Meme Ride Home Podcast.\n\n03:55.720 --> 03:57.760\n It's a technology podcast I've been listening to\n\n03:57.760 --> 04:00.280\n for a while and really enjoying.\n\n04:00.280 --> 04:01.720\n It goes straight to the point,\n\n04:01.720 --> 04:03.680\n gives you the tech news you need to know\n\n04:03.680 --> 04:07.080\n and provides minimal but essential context.\n\n04:07.080 --> 04:10.080\n It's released every day by 5 p.m. Eastern\n\n04:10.080 --> 04:12.600\n and is only about 15 to 20 minutes long.\n\n04:13.460 --> 04:16.240\n For fun, I like building apps on smartphones,\n\n04:16.240 --> 04:18.800\n most on Android, so I'm always a little curious\n\n04:18.800 --> 04:21.120\n about new flagship phones that come out.\n\n04:21.120 --> 04:25.600\n I saw that Samsung announced the new Galaxy S20\n\n04:25.600 --> 04:29.360\n and of course, right away, Tech Meme Ride Home\n\n04:29.360 --> 04:33.200\n has a new episode that summarizes all that I needed to know\n\n04:33.200 --> 04:35.520\n about this new device.\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:38.560\n They've also started to do weekend bonus episodes\n\n04:38.560 --> 04:42.020\n with interviews of people like AWOL founder Steve Case\n\n04:42.020 --> 04:45.600\n on investing and Gary Marcus on AI,\n\n04:45.600 --> 04:48.680\n who I've also interviewed on this podcast.\n\n04:48.680 --> 04:51.600\n You can find the Tech Meme Ride Home Podcast\n\n04:51.600 --> 04:56.600\n if you search your podcast app for Ride Home, two words.\n\n04:56.680 --> 05:00.160\n Then subscribe, enjoy, and keep up to date\n\n05:00.160 --> 05:02.560\n with the latest tech news.\n\n05:02.560 --> 05:06.660\n And now, here's my conversation with Scott Aaronson.\n\n05:07.680 --> 05:11.640\n I sometimes get criticism from a listener here and there\n\n05:11.640 --> 05:13.400\n that while having a conversation\n\n05:13.400 --> 05:16.200\n with a world class mathematician, physicist,\n\n05:16.200 --> 05:18.200\n neurobiologist, aerospace engineer,\n\n05:18.200 --> 05:21.740\n or a theoretical computer scientist like yourself,\n\n05:21.740 --> 05:24.680\n I waste time by asking philosophical questions\n\n05:24.680 --> 05:28.880\n about free will, consciousness, mortality, love,\n\n05:28.880 --> 05:31.920\n nature of truth, super intelligence,\n\n05:31.920 --> 05:33.480\n whether time travel is possible,\n\n05:33.480 --> 05:35.960\n whether space time is emergent and fundamental,\n\n05:36.840 --> 05:39.400\n even the crazier questions like whether aliens exist,\n\n05:39.400 --> 05:40.840\n what their language might look like,\n\n05:40.840 --> 05:43.020\n what their math might look like,\n\n05:43.020 --> 05:44.700\n whether math is invented or discovered,\n\n05:44.700 --> 05:47.960\n and of course, whether we live in a simulation or not.\n\n05:47.960 --> 05:48.800\n So I try.\n\n05:48.800 --> 05:49.880\n Out with it.\n\n05:49.880 --> 05:51.360\n Out with it.\n\n05:51.360 --> 05:55.460\n I try to dance back and forth from the deep technical\n\n05:55.460 --> 05:59.040\n to the philosophical, so I've done that quite a bit.\n\n05:59.040 --> 06:01.680\n So you're a world class computer scientist,\n\n06:01.680 --> 06:04.120\n and yet you've written about this very point,\n\n06:04.120 --> 06:06.720\n the philosophy is important for experts\n\n06:06.720 --> 06:09.040\n in any technical discipline,\n\n06:09.040 --> 06:11.140\n though they somehow seem to avoid this.\n\n06:11.140 --> 06:13.460\n So I thought it'd be really interesting\n\n06:13.460 --> 06:15.100\n to talk to you about this point.\n\n06:15.100 --> 06:17.740\n Why should we computer scientists, mathematicians,\n\n06:17.740 --> 06:20.780\n physicists care about philosophy, do you think?\n\n06:20.780 --> 06:23.020\n Well, I would reframe the question a little bit.\n\n06:23.020 --> 06:26.760\n I mean, philosophy almost by definition\n\n06:26.760 --> 06:30.940\n is the subject that's concerned with the biggest questions\n\n06:30.940 --> 06:33.160\n that you could possibly ask, right?\n\n06:33.160 --> 06:35.740\n So the ones you mentioned, right?\n\n06:35.740 --> 06:38.440\n Are we living in a simulation?\n\n06:38.440 --> 06:41.720\n Are we alone in the universe?\n\n06:41.720 --> 06:44.360\n How should we even think about such questions?\n\n06:44.360 --> 06:46.000\n Is the future determined,\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.560\n and what do we even mean by it being determined?\n\n06:49.560 --> 06:51.760\n Why are we alive at the time we are\n\n06:51.760 --> 06:53.200\n and not at some other time?\n\n06:55.320 --> 06:58.020\n And when you sort of contemplate\n\n06:58.020 --> 06:59.560\n the enormity of those questions,\n\n06:59.560 --> 07:01.080\n I think you could ask,\n\n07:01.080 --> 07:04.560\n well, then why be concerned with anything else, right?\n\n07:04.560 --> 07:08.760\n Why not spend your whole life on those questions?\n\n07:08.760 --> 07:10.120\n I think in some sense,\n\n07:10.120 --> 07:13.800\n that is the right way to phrase the question.\n\n07:13.800 --> 07:18.800\n And actually, what we learned, I mean, throughout history,\n\n07:19.240 --> 07:21.920\n but really starting with the scientific revolution\n\n07:21.920 --> 07:24.000\n with Galileo and so on,\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:26.840\n is that there is a good reason to focus\n\n07:26.840 --> 07:31.320\n on narrower questions, more technical,\n\n07:31.320 --> 07:33.600\n mathematical or empirical questions.\n\n07:33.600 --> 07:36.520\n And that is that you can actually make progress on them,\n\n07:36.520 --> 07:39.260\n and you can actually often answer them.\n\n07:39.260 --> 07:41.760\n And sometimes they actually tell you something\n\n07:41.760 --> 07:43.820\n about the philosophical questions\n\n07:43.820 --> 07:48.500\n that sort of maybe motivated your curiosity as a child.\n\n07:48.500 --> 07:51.760\n They don't necessarily resolve the philosophical questions,\n\n07:51.760 --> 07:53.300\n but sometimes they reframe\n\n07:53.300 --> 07:55.120\n your whole understanding of them, right?\n\n07:55.120 --> 07:58.120\n And so for me, philosophy is just the thing\n\n07:58.120 --> 08:00.920\n that you have in the background from the very beginning\n\n08:00.920 --> 08:05.480\n that you want to, these are sort of the reasons\n\n08:05.480 --> 08:08.640\n why you went into intellectual life in the first place,\n\n08:08.640 --> 08:10.620\n at least the reasons why I did, right?\n\n08:11.720 --> 08:15.200\n But math and science are tools that we have\n\n08:15.200 --> 08:17.540\n for actually making progress.\n\n08:17.540 --> 08:21.480\n And hopefully even changing our understanding\n\n08:21.480 --> 08:23.280\n of these philosophical questions,\n\n08:23.280 --> 08:26.400\n sometimes even more than philosophy itself does.\n\n08:26.400 --> 08:30.560\n Why do you think computer scientists avoid these questions?\n\n08:30.560 --> 08:31.880\n We'll run away from them a little bit,\n\n08:31.880 --> 08:34.600\n at least in a technical scientific discourse.\n\n08:34.600 --> 08:37.000\n Well, I'm not sure if they do so\n\n08:37.000 --> 08:39.200\n more than any other scientists do.\n\n08:39.200 --> 08:44.200\n I mean, Alan Turing was famously interested\n\n08:44.400 --> 08:49.400\n and his most famous, one of his two most famous papers\n\n08:49.760 --> 08:52.040\n was in a philosophy journal mind.\n\n08:52.040 --> 08:54.700\n It was the one where he proposed the Turing test.\n\n08:55.640 --> 08:59.920\n He took a Wittgenstein's course at Cambridge,\n\n08:59.920 --> 09:01.440\n argued with him.\n\n09:01.440 --> 09:03.840\n I just recently learned that little bit\n\n09:03.840 --> 09:05.340\n and it's actually fascinating.\n\n09:05.340 --> 09:08.440\n I was trying to look for resources\n\n09:08.440 --> 09:12.400\n in trying to understand where the sources of disagreement\n\n09:12.400 --> 09:15.720\n and debates between Wittgenstein and Turing were.\n\n09:15.720 --> 09:17.480\n That's interesting that these two minds\n\n09:17.480 --> 09:20.200\n have somehow met in the arc of history.\n\n09:20.200 --> 09:25.200\n Yeah, well, the transcript of the course,\n\n09:25.200 --> 09:26.880\n which was in 1939, right,\n\n09:26.880 --> 09:29.960\n is one of the more fascinating documents that I've ever read\n\n09:29.960 --> 09:33.560\n because Wittgenstein is trying to say,\n\n09:33.560 --> 09:36.180\n well, all of these formal systems\n\n09:36.180 --> 09:41.180\n are just complete irrelevancies, right?\n\n09:41.680 --> 09:44.560\n If a formal system is irrelevant, who cares?\n\n09:44.560 --> 09:46.880\n Why does that matter in real life, right?\n\n09:46.880 --> 09:49.000\n And Turing is saying, well, look,\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:52.640\n if you use an inconsistent formal system to design a bridge,\n\n09:52.640 --> 09:55.160\n the bridge may collapse, right?\n\n09:55.160 --> 09:58.900\n And so Turing, in some sense, is thinking decades ahead,\n\n09:58.900 --> 10:01.640\n you know, I think, of where Wittgenstein is,\n\n10:01.640 --> 10:05.040\n to where the formal systems are actually going to be used\n\n10:05.040 --> 10:08.720\n in computers, right, to actually do things in the world.\n\n10:08.720 --> 10:10.400\n You know, and it's interesting that Turing\n\n10:10.400 --> 10:13.120\n actually dropped the course halfway through.\n\n10:13.120 --> 10:13.960\n Why?\n\n10:13.960 --> 10:15.320\n Because he had to go to Bletchley Park\n\n10:15.320 --> 10:18.240\n and work on something of more immediate importance.\n\n10:18.240 --> 10:19.880\n That's fascinating.\n\n10:19.880 --> 10:22.180\n Take a step from philosophy to actual,\n\n10:22.180 --> 10:25.020\n like the biggest possible step to actual engineering\n\n10:25.020 --> 10:26.400\n with actual real impact.\n\n10:26.400 --> 10:29.160\n Yeah, and I would say more generally, right,\n\n10:30.360 --> 10:35.100\n a lot of scientists are interested in philosophy,\n\n10:35.100 --> 10:36.700\n but they're also busy, right?\n\n10:36.700 --> 10:39.460\n And they have a lot on their plate,\n\n10:39.460 --> 10:42.760\n and there are a lot of sort of very concrete questions\n\n10:42.760 --> 10:44.880\n that are already not answered,\n\n10:44.880 --> 10:47.940\n but look like they might be answerable, right?\n\n10:47.940 --> 10:52.880\n And so then you could say, well, then why break your brain\n\n10:52.880 --> 10:55.940\n over these metaphysically unanswerable questions\n\n10:55.940 --> 10:59.340\n when there were all of these answerable ones instead?\n\n10:59.340 --> 11:03.240\n So I think, you know, for me,\n\n11:03.240 --> 11:06.240\n I enjoy talking about philosophy.\n\n11:06.240 --> 11:09.840\n I even go to philosophy conferences sometimes,\n\n11:09.840 --> 11:12.040\n such as the FQXI conferences.\n\n11:12.040 --> 11:14.920\n I enjoy interacting with philosophers.\n\n11:14.920 --> 11:17.740\n I would not want to be a professional philosopher\n\n11:17.740 --> 11:20.880\n because I like being in a field where I feel like,\n\n11:20.880 --> 11:25.400\n you know, if I get too confused\n\n11:25.400 --> 11:27.100\n about the sort of eternal questions,\n\n11:27.100 --> 11:30.060\n then I can actually make progress on something.\n\n11:30.060 --> 11:32.840\n Can you maybe link on that for just a little longer?\n\n11:32.840 --> 11:34.600\n What do you think is the difference?\n\n11:34.600 --> 11:37.640\n So like the corollary of the criticism\n\n11:37.640 --> 11:40.120\n that I mentioned previously,\n\n11:40.120 --> 11:42.520\n that why ask the philosophical questions\n\n11:42.520 --> 11:44.960\n of the mathematician is if you want\n\n11:44.960 --> 11:46.220\n to ask philosophical questions,\n\n11:46.220 --> 11:49.020\n then invite a real philosopher on and ask them.\n\n11:49.020 --> 11:51.200\n So what's the difference between the way\n\n11:51.200 --> 11:52.920\n a computer scientist or mathematician\n\n11:52.920 --> 11:54.640\n ponders a philosophical question\n\n11:54.640 --> 11:57.280\n and a philosopher ponders a philosophical question?\n\n11:57.280 --> 11:59.280\n Well, I mean, a lot of it just depends\n\n11:59.280 --> 12:01.000\n on the individual, right?\n\n12:01.000 --> 12:04.760\n It's hard to make generalizations about entire fields,\n\n12:04.760 --> 12:09.560\n but, you know, I think if we tried to,\n\n12:09.560 --> 12:11.440\n if we tried to stereotype, you know,\n\n12:11.440 --> 12:16.440\n we would say that scientists very often\n\n12:16.440 --> 12:21.440\n will be less careful in their use of words.\n\n12:21.860 --> 12:24.160\n You know, I mean, philosophers are really experts\n\n12:24.160 --> 12:27.140\n in sort of, you know, like when I talk to them,\n\n12:27.140 --> 12:28.820\n they will just pounce if I, you know,\n\n12:28.820 --> 12:30.780\n use the wrong phrase for something.\n\n12:30.780 --> 12:32.540\n Experts is a very nice word.\n\n12:32.540 --> 12:34.060\n You could say sticklers.\n\n12:34.060 --> 12:35.980\n Sticklers, yeah, yeah, yeah, or, you know,\n\n12:35.980 --> 12:39.140\n they will sort of interrogate my word choices,\n\n12:39.140 --> 12:41.360\n let's say, to a much greater extent\n\n12:41.360 --> 12:42.900\n than scientists would, right?\n\n12:42.900 --> 12:46.300\n And scientists, you know, will often,\n\n12:46.300 --> 12:48.940\n if you ask them about a philosophical problem,\n\n12:48.940 --> 12:51.900\n like the hard problem of consciousness\n\n12:51.900 --> 12:53.580\n or free will or whatever,\n\n12:53.580 --> 12:55.740\n they will try to relate it back to, you know,\n\n12:55.740 --> 13:00.740\n recent research, you know, research about neurobiology\n\n13:01.200 --> 13:03.880\n or, you know, the best of all is research\n\n13:03.880 --> 13:06.480\n that they personally are involved with, right?\n\n13:06.480 --> 13:10.160\n And, you know, of course they will want to talk about that,\n\n13:10.160 --> 13:12.260\n you know, and it is what they will think of, you know,\n\n13:12.260 --> 13:14.140\n and of course you could have an argument\n\n13:14.140 --> 13:17.300\n that maybe, you know, it's all interesting as it goes,\n\n13:17.300 --> 13:20.100\n but maybe none of it touches the philosophical question,\n\n13:20.100 --> 13:20.940\n right?\n\n13:20.940 --> 13:24.300\n But, you know, but maybe, you know, a science,\n\n13:24.300 --> 13:26.600\n you know, at least it, as I said,\n\n13:26.600 --> 13:29.020\n it does tell us concrete things.\n\n13:29.020 --> 13:33.520\n And, you know, even if like a deep dive into neurobiology\n\n13:33.520 --> 13:36.580\n will not answer the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n13:36.580 --> 13:40.540\n you know, maybe it can take us about as far as we can get\n\n13:40.540 --> 13:44.420\n toward, you know, expanding our minds about it,\n\n13:44.420 --> 13:47.220\n you know, toward thinking about it in a different way.\n\n13:48.760 --> 13:51.080\n Well, I mean, I think neurobiology can do that,\n\n13:51.080 --> 13:53.840\n but, you know, with these profound philosophical questions,\n\n13:53.840 --> 13:56.940\n I mean, also art and literature do that, right?\n\n13:56.940 --> 13:58.020\n They're all different ways\n\n13:58.020 --> 14:00.260\n of trying to approach these questions that, you know,\n\n14:00.260 --> 14:02.220\n we don't, for which we don't even know really\n\n14:02.220 --> 14:03.700\n what an answer would look like,\n\n14:03.700 --> 14:06.200\n but, and yet somehow we can't help,\n\n14:06.200 --> 14:07.820\n but keep returning to the questions.\n\n14:07.820 --> 14:09.260\n And you have a kind of mathematical,\n\n14:09.260 --> 14:11.260\n beautiful mathematical way of discussing this\n\n14:11.260 --> 14:12.740\n with the idea of Q prime.\n\n14:12.740 --> 14:13.580\n Oh, right.\n\n14:13.580 --> 14:16.780\n You write that usually the only way to make progress\n\n14:16.780 --> 14:20.060\n on the big questions, like the philosophical questions\n\n14:20.060 --> 14:24.340\n we're talking about now is to pick off smaller sub questions.\n\n14:24.340 --> 14:26.380\n Ideally sub questions that you can attack\n\n14:26.380 --> 14:29.140\n using math, empirical observation, or both.\n\n14:29.140 --> 14:31.380\n You define the idea of a Q prime.\n\n14:31.380 --> 14:36.140\n So given an unanswerable philosophical riddle Q,\n\n14:36.140 --> 14:39.700\n replace it with a merely, in quotes, scientific\n\n14:39.700 --> 14:41.900\n or mathematical question Q prime,\n\n14:41.900 --> 14:44.840\n which captures part of what people have wanted to know\n\n14:44.840 --> 14:47.300\n when they first asked Q.\n\n14:47.300 --> 14:49.900\n Then with luck, one solves Q prime.\n\n14:49.900 --> 14:54.900\n So you described some examples of such Q prime sub questions\n\n14:55.420 --> 14:59.180\n in your long essay titled,\n\n14:59.180 --> 15:02.460\n Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity.\n\n15:02.460 --> 15:04.560\n So you catalog the various Q primes\n\n15:04.560 --> 15:07.140\n on which you think theoretical computer science\n\n15:07.140 --> 15:08.020\n has made progress.\n\n15:08.020 --> 15:12.260\n Can you mention a few favorites, if any pop to mind,\n\n15:12.260 --> 15:13.100\n or do you remember some?\n\n15:13.100 --> 15:13.940\n Well, yeah.\n\n15:13.940 --> 15:16.940\n So, I mean, I would say some of the most famous examples\n\n15:16.940 --> 15:20.740\n in history of that sort of replacement were,\n\n15:20.740 --> 15:23.240\n I mean, to go back to Alan Turing, right?\n\n15:23.240 --> 15:26.460\n What he did in his computing machinery\n\n15:26.460 --> 15:29.340\n and intelligence paper was exactly,\n\n15:29.340 --> 15:32.100\n he explicitly started with the question,\n\n15:32.100 --> 15:33.820\n can machines think?\n\n15:33.820 --> 15:35.780\n And then he said, sorry,\n\n15:35.780 --> 15:38.020\n I think that question is too meaningless,\n\n15:38.020 --> 15:40.380\n but here's a different question.\n\n15:40.380 --> 15:42.140\n Could you program a computer\n\n15:42.140 --> 15:43.620\n so that you couldn't tell the difference\n\n15:43.620 --> 15:45.220\n between it and a human, right?\n\n15:45.220 --> 15:46.060\n And yeah.\n\n15:46.060 --> 15:47.940\n So in the very first few sentences,\n\n15:47.940 --> 15:50.900\n he in fact just formulates the Q prime question.\n\n15:50.900 --> 15:52.600\n He does precisely that.\n\n15:52.600 --> 15:56.140\n Or we could look at G\u00f6del, right?\n\n15:56.140 --> 16:00.420\n Where you had these philosophers arguing for centuries\n\n16:00.420 --> 16:03.060\n about the limits of mathematical reasoning, right?\n\n16:03.060 --> 16:04.660\n The limits of formal systems.\n\n16:04.660 --> 16:08.740\n And then by the early 20th century,\n\n16:08.740 --> 16:12.340\n logicians, starting with Frege, Russell,\n\n16:12.340 --> 16:15.480\n and then most spectacularly G\u00f6del,\n\n16:15.480 --> 16:18.100\n managed to reframe those questions as,\n\n16:18.100 --> 16:19.840\n look, we have these formal systems.\n\n16:19.840 --> 16:21.500\n They have these definite rules.\n\n16:21.500 --> 16:23.480\n Are there questions that we can phrase\n\n16:23.480 --> 16:25.740\n within the rules of these systems\n\n16:25.740 --> 16:28.220\n that are not provable within the rules of the systems?\n\n16:28.220 --> 16:30.500\n And can we prove that fact, right?\n\n16:30.500 --> 16:34.740\n And so that would be another example.\n\n16:34.740 --> 16:36.640\n You know, I had this essay called\n\n16:36.640 --> 16:38.980\n The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine.\n\n16:38.980 --> 16:41.900\n That was one of the crazier things I've written,\n\n16:41.900 --> 16:44.740\n but I tried to do something,\n\n16:44.740 --> 16:48.740\n or to advocate doing something similar there for free will,\n\n16:48.740 --> 16:53.220\n where instead of talking about is free will real,\n\n16:53.220 --> 16:55.500\n where we get hung up on the meaning of,\n\n16:55.500 --> 16:57.500\n what exactly do we mean by freedom?\n\n16:57.500 --> 16:59.740\n And can you have, can you be,\n\n16:59.740 --> 17:02.220\n or do we mean compatibilist free will,\n\n17:02.220 --> 17:03.660\n libertarian free will?\n\n17:03.660 --> 17:05.100\n What do these things mean?\n\n17:05.100 --> 17:08.200\n You know, I suggested just asking the question,\n\n17:08.200 --> 17:12.320\n how well in principle, consistently with the laws of physics,\n\n17:12.320 --> 17:15.100\n could a person's behavior be predicted?\n\n17:15.100 --> 17:16.620\n You know, without, so let's say,\n\n17:16.620 --> 17:18.820\n destroying the person's brain, you know,\n\n17:18.820 --> 17:22.140\n taking it apart in the process of trying to predict them.\n\n17:22.140 --> 17:24.620\n And, you know, and that actually,\n\n17:24.620 --> 17:27.700\n asking that question gets you into all sorts of meaty\n\n17:27.700 --> 17:31.100\n and interesting issues, you know, issues of,\n\n17:31.100 --> 17:33.820\n what is the computational substrate of the brain?\n\n17:33.820 --> 17:37.100\n You know, or can you understand the brain, you know,\n\n17:37.100 --> 17:39.740\n just at the sort of level of the neurons, you know,\n\n17:39.740 --> 17:42.380\n at sort of the abstraction of a neural network,\n\n17:42.380 --> 17:44.940\n or do you need to go deeper to the, you know,\n\n17:44.940 --> 17:48.060\n molecular level and ultimately even to the quantum level?\n\n17:48.060 --> 17:48.900\n Right, and of course,\n\n17:48.900 --> 17:52.700\n that would put limits on predictability if you did.\n\n17:52.700 --> 17:53.940\n So you need to reduce,\n\n17:53.940 --> 17:58.580\n you need to reduce the mind to a computational device,\n\n17:58.580 --> 18:01.180\n like formalize it so then you can make predictions\n\n18:01.180 --> 18:03.860\n about what, you know, whether you could predict the behavior\n\n18:03.860 --> 18:04.700\n of the system. Well, if you were trying\n\n18:04.700 --> 18:06.860\n to predict a person, yeah, then presumably,\n\n18:06.860 --> 18:09.180\n you would need some model of their brain, right?\n\n18:09.180 --> 18:11.180\n And now the question becomes one of,\n\n18:11.180 --> 18:13.780\n how accurate can such a model become?\n\n18:13.780 --> 18:16.780\n Can you make a model that will be accurate enough\n\n18:16.780 --> 18:21.060\n to really seriously threaten people's sense of free will?\n\n18:21.060 --> 18:23.660\n You know, not just metaphysically, but like really,\n\n18:23.660 --> 18:25.140\n I have written in this envelope\n\n18:25.140 --> 18:26.780\n what you were going to say next.\n\n18:26.780 --> 18:28.940\n Is accuracy the right term here?\n\n18:28.940 --> 18:32.620\n So it's also a level of abstraction has to be right.\n\n18:32.620 --> 18:37.620\n So if you're accurate at the, somehow at the quantum level,\n\n18:39.060 --> 18:42.980\n that may not be convincing to us at the human level.\n\n18:42.980 --> 18:46.100\n Well, right, but the question is what accuracy\n\n18:46.100 --> 18:49.020\n at the sort of level of the underlying mechanisms\n\n18:49.020 --> 18:52.180\n do you need in order to predict the behavior, right?\n\n18:52.180 --> 18:54.300\n At the end of the day, the test is just,\n\n18:54.300 --> 18:57.860\n can you, you know, foresee what the person is going to do?\n\n18:57.860 --> 19:02.860\n Right, I am, you know, and in discussions of free will,\n\n19:03.340 --> 19:06.340\n you know, it seems like both sides wanna, you know,\n\n19:06.340 --> 19:09.420\n very quickly dismiss that question as irrelevant.\n\n19:09.420 --> 19:11.420\n Well, to me, it's totally relevant.\n\n19:11.420 --> 19:14.300\n Okay, because, you know, if someone says,\n\n19:14.300 --> 19:16.900\n oh, well, you know, a Laplace demon\n\n19:16.900 --> 19:19.900\n that knew the complete state of the universe,\n\n19:19.900 --> 19:22.140\n you know, could predict everything you're going to do,\n\n19:22.140 --> 19:24.100\n therefore you don't have free will.\n\n19:24.100 --> 19:27.020\n You know, it doesn't trouble me that much because,\n\n19:27.020 --> 19:29.820\n well, you know, I've never met such a demon, right?\n\n19:29.820 --> 19:34.140\n You know, and we, you know, we even have some reasons\n\n19:34.140 --> 19:35.180\n to think, you know, maybe, you know,\n\n19:35.180 --> 19:37.260\n it could not exist as part of our world,\n\n19:37.260 --> 19:40.740\n you know, it's only an abstraction, a thought experiment.\n\n19:40.740 --> 19:42.540\n On the other hand, if someone said,\n\n19:42.540 --> 19:44.940\n well, you know, I have this brain scanning machine,\n\n19:44.940 --> 19:47.180\n you know, you step into it and then, you know,\n\n19:47.180 --> 19:50.220\n every paper that you will ever write, it will write,\n\n19:50.220 --> 19:52.420\n you know, every thought that you will have, you know,\n\n19:52.420 --> 19:55.740\n even right now about the machine itself, it will foresee.\n\n19:55.740 --> 19:58.620\n You know, well, if you can actually demonstrate that,\n\n19:58.620 --> 20:01.620\n then I think, you know, that sort of threatens\n\n20:01.620 --> 20:04.380\n my internal sense of having free will\n\n20:04.380 --> 20:06.340\n in a much more visceral way.\n\n20:06.340 --> 20:08.980\n You know, but now you notice that we're asking\n\n20:08.980 --> 20:11.580\n a much more empirical question.\n\n20:11.580 --> 20:14.700\n We're asking, is such a machine possible or isn't it?\n\n20:14.700 --> 20:16.260\n We're asking, if it's not possible,\n\n20:16.260 --> 20:18.380\n then what in the laws of physics\n\n20:18.380 --> 20:21.180\n or what about the behavior of the brain,\n\n20:21.180 --> 20:22.980\n you know, prevents it from existing?\n\n20:22.980 --> 20:25.260\n So if you could philosophize a little bit\n\n20:25.260 --> 20:27.740\n within this empirical question,\n\n20:27.740 --> 20:31.420\n where do you think would enter the,\n\n20:31.420 --> 20:33.820\n by which mechanism would enter the possibility\n\n20:33.820 --> 20:35.580\n that we can't predict the outcome?\n\n20:35.580 --> 20:37.220\n So there would be something\n\n20:37.220 --> 20:38.860\n that would be akin to a free will.\n\n20:38.860 --> 20:42.460\n Yeah, well, you could say the sort of obvious possibility,\n\n20:42.460 --> 20:45.660\n which was, you know, recognized by Eddington\n\n20:45.660 --> 20:48.020\n and many others about as soon as quantum mechanics\n\n20:48.020 --> 20:52.380\n was discovered in the 1920s, was that if,\n\n20:53.300 --> 20:56.180\n you know, let's say a sodium ion channel,\n\n20:56.180 --> 21:00.500\n you know, in the brain, right?\n\n21:00.500 --> 21:03.980\n You know, its behavior is chaotic, right?\n\n21:03.980 --> 21:06.340\n It's sort of, it's governed by these\n\n21:06.340 --> 21:10.940\n Hodgley\u2013Huckskin equations in neuroscience, right?\n\n21:10.940 --> 21:12.500\n Which are differential equations\n\n21:12.500 --> 21:14.780\n that have a stochastic component, right?\n\n21:14.780 --> 21:17.100\n Now, where does, you know, and this ultimately governs,\n\n21:17.100 --> 21:19.460\n let's say whether a neuron will fire or not fire, right?\n\n21:19.460 --> 21:21.700\n So that's the basic chemical process\n\n21:21.700 --> 21:23.860\n or electrical process by which signals\n\n21:23.860 --> 21:24.780\n are sent in the brain.\n\n21:24.780 --> 21:25.980\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n21:25.980 --> 21:28.780\n And, you know, and so you could ask,\n\n21:28.780 --> 21:31.380\n well, where does the randomness in the process,\n\n21:31.380 --> 21:34.100\n you know, that neuroscientists,\n\n21:34.100 --> 21:38.020\n or what neuroscientists would treat as randomness,\n\n21:38.020 --> 21:39.380\n where does it come from?\n\n21:39.380 --> 21:41.700\n You know, ultimately it's thermal noise, right?\n\n21:41.700 --> 21:43.580\n Where does thermal noise come from?\n\n21:43.580 --> 21:44.860\n But ultimately, you know,\n\n21:44.860 --> 21:46.780\n there were some quantum mechanical events\n\n21:46.780 --> 21:48.060\n at the molecular level\n\n21:48.060 --> 21:50.940\n that are getting sort of chaotically amplified\n\n21:50.940 --> 21:53.660\n by, you know, a sort of butterfly effect.\n\n21:53.660 --> 21:57.220\n And so, you know, even if you knew\n\n21:57.220 --> 22:00.300\n the complete quantum state of someone's brain,\n\n22:00.300 --> 22:02.780\n you know, at best you could predict the probabilities\n\n22:02.780 --> 22:05.420\n that they would do one thing or do another thing, right?\n\n22:05.420 --> 22:08.500\n I think that part is actually relatively uncontroversial,\n\n22:08.500 --> 22:09.340\n right?\n\n22:09.340 --> 22:13.340\n The controversial question is whether any of it matters\n\n22:13.340 --> 22:16.100\n for the sort of philosophical questions that we care about.\n\n22:16.100 --> 22:18.340\n Because you could say, if all it's doing\n\n22:18.340 --> 22:20.340\n is just injecting some randomness\n\n22:20.340 --> 22:23.700\n into an otherwise completely mechanistic process,\n\n22:23.700 --> 22:25.140\n well, then who cares, right?\n\n22:25.140 --> 22:28.460\n And more concretely, if you could build a machine\n\n22:28.460 --> 22:30.980\n that, you know, could just calculate\n\n22:30.980 --> 22:33.540\n even just the probabilities\n\n22:33.540 --> 22:35.980\n of all of the possible things that you would do, right?\n\n22:35.980 --> 22:39.940\n And, you know, of all the things that said\n\n22:39.940 --> 22:41.860\n you had a 10% chance of doing,\n\n22:41.860 --> 22:43.980\n you did exactly a 10th of them, you know,\n\n22:43.980 --> 22:45.580\n and so on and so on.\n\n22:45.580 --> 22:48.180\n And that somehow also takes away the feeling of free will.\n\n22:48.180 --> 22:49.020\n Exactly.\n\n22:49.020 --> 22:51.900\n I mean, to me, it seems essentially just as bad\n\n22:51.900 --> 22:54.860\n as if the machine deterministically predicted you.\n\n22:54.860 --> 22:57.340\n It seems, you know, hardly different from that.\n\n22:57.340 --> 23:02.340\n So then, but a more subtle question\n\n23:02.420 --> 23:04.060\n is could you even learn enough\n\n23:04.060 --> 23:06.340\n about someone's brain to do that, okay?\n\n23:06.340 --> 23:09.540\n Because, you know, another central fact\n\n23:09.540 --> 23:14.140\n about quantum mechanics is that making a measurement\n\n23:14.140 --> 23:18.060\n on a quantum state is an inherently destructive operation.\n\n23:18.060 --> 23:21.660\n Okay, so, you know, if I want to measure the, you know,\n\n23:21.660 --> 23:23.500\n position of a particle, right?\n\n23:23.500 --> 23:25.300\n It was, well, before I measured,\n\n23:25.300 --> 23:28.420\n it had a superposition over many different positions.\n\n23:28.420 --> 23:30.980\n As soon as I measure, I localize it, right?\n\n23:30.980 --> 23:32.340\n So now I know the position,\n\n23:32.340 --> 23:35.260\n but I've also fundamentally changed the state.\n\n23:35.260 --> 23:39.940\n And so you could say, well, maybe in trying to build\n\n23:39.940 --> 23:42.780\n a model of someone's brain that was accurate enough\n\n23:42.780 --> 23:44.700\n to actually, you know, make, let's say,\n\n23:44.700 --> 23:48.340\n even well calibrated probabilistic predictions\n\n23:48.340 --> 23:49.980\n of their future behavior,\n\n23:49.980 --> 23:51.740\n maybe you would have to make measurements\n\n23:51.740 --> 23:53.140\n that were just so accurate\n\n23:53.140 --> 23:56.180\n that you would just fundamentally alter their brain, okay?\n\n23:56.180 --> 23:59.580\n Or maybe not, maybe you only, you know,\n\n23:59.580 --> 24:02.380\n it would suffice to just make some nanorobots\n\n24:02.380 --> 24:05.700\n that just measured some sort of much larger scale,\n\n24:05.700 --> 24:09.300\n you know, macroscopic behavior, like, you know,\n\n24:09.300 --> 24:10.780\n what is this neuron doing?\n\n24:10.780 --> 24:12.260\n What is that neuron doing?\n\n24:12.260 --> 24:13.860\n Maybe that would be enough.\n\n24:13.860 --> 24:16.940\n See, but now, you know, what I claim is that\n\n24:16.940 --> 24:19.220\n we're now asking a question, you know,\n\n24:19.220 --> 24:22.660\n in which, you know, it is possible to envision\n\n24:22.660 --> 24:24.620\n what progress on it would look like.\n\n24:24.620 --> 24:25.940\n Yeah, but just as you said,\n\n24:25.940 --> 24:28.900\n that question may be slightly detached\n\n24:28.900 --> 24:31.740\n from the philosophical question in the sense\n\n24:31.740 --> 24:33.860\n if consciousness somehow has a role\n\n24:33.860 --> 24:36.060\n to the experience of free will.\n\n24:36.060 --> 24:38.340\n Because ultimately, when we're talking about free will,\n\n24:38.340 --> 24:42.260\n we're also talking about not just the predictability\n\n24:42.260 --> 24:44.900\n of our actions, but somehow the experience\n\n24:44.900 --> 24:46.340\n of that predictability.\n\n24:46.340 --> 24:49.420\n Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of philosophical questions\n\n24:49.420 --> 24:52.260\n ultimately, like, feedback to the hard problem\n\n24:52.260 --> 24:53.540\n of consciousness, you know,\n\n24:53.540 --> 24:56.660\n and as much as you can try to sort of talk around it\n\n24:56.660 --> 24:57.500\n or not, right?\n\n24:57.500 --> 24:59.980\n And, you know, and there is a reason\n\n24:59.980 --> 25:01.820\n why people try to talk around it,\n\n25:01.820 --> 25:03.580\n which is that, you know,\n\n25:03.580 --> 25:07.780\n Democritus talked about the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n25:07.780 --> 25:11.180\n you know, in 400 BC in terms that would be\n\n25:11.180 --> 25:13.900\n totally recognizable to us today, right?\n\n25:13.900 --> 25:16.980\n And it's really not clear if there's been progress since\n\n25:16.980 --> 25:19.540\n or what progress could possibly consist of.\n\n25:19.540 --> 25:22.420\n Is there a Q prime type of subquestion\n\n25:22.420 --> 25:24.380\n that could help us get at consciousness?\n\n25:24.380 --> 25:25.660\n It's something about consciousness.\n\n25:25.660 --> 25:27.740\n Well, I mean, well, I mean, there is the whole question\n\n25:27.740 --> 25:29.620\n of, you know, of AI, right?\n\n25:29.620 --> 25:33.700\n Of, you know, can you build a human level\n\n25:33.700 --> 25:35.980\n or superhuman level AI?\n\n25:35.980 --> 25:39.140\n And, you know, can it work in a completely different\n\n25:39.140 --> 25:40.380\n substrate from the brain?\n\n25:40.380 --> 25:41.580\n I mean, you know, and of course,\n\n25:41.580 --> 25:43.460\n that was Alan Turing's point.\n\n25:43.460 --> 25:45.500\n And, you know, and even if that was done,\n\n25:45.500 --> 25:47.660\n it's, you know, maybe people would still argue\n\n25:47.660 --> 25:49.940\n about the hard problem of consciousness, right?\n\n25:49.940 --> 25:53.100\n And yet, you know, my claim is a little different.\n\n25:53.100 --> 25:55.860\n My claim is that in a world where, you know,\n\n25:55.860 --> 25:58.980\n there were, you know, human level AIs\n\n25:58.980 --> 26:01.980\n or we'd been even overtaken by such AIs,\n\n26:01.980 --> 26:05.940\n the entire discussion of the hard problem of consciousness\n\n26:05.940 --> 26:07.660\n would have a different character, right?\n\n26:07.660 --> 26:10.420\n It would take place in different terms in such a world,\n\n26:10.420 --> 26:12.740\n even if we hadn't answered the question.\n\n26:12.740 --> 26:15.620\n And my claim about free will would be similar, right?\n\n26:15.620 --> 26:19.060\n That if this prediction machine that I was talking about\n\n26:19.060 --> 26:21.980\n could actually be built, well, now the entire discussion\n\n26:21.980 --> 26:24.620\n of the, you know, of free will is sort of transformed\n\n26:24.620 --> 26:27.380\n by that, you know, even if in some sense\n\n26:27.380 --> 26:30.180\n the metaphysical question hasn't been answered.\n\n26:31.780 --> 26:34.180\n Yeah, exactly, it transforms it fundamentally\n\n26:34.180 --> 26:35.900\n because say that machine does tell you\n\n26:35.900 --> 26:37.620\n that it can predict perfectly\n\n26:37.620 --> 26:40.100\n and yet there is this deep experience of free will\n\n26:40.100 --> 26:43.100\n and then that changes the question completely.\n\n26:43.100 --> 26:46.220\n And it starts actually getting to the question\n\n26:46.220 --> 26:51.220\n of the AGI, the touring questions\n\n26:51.580 --> 26:54.940\n of the demonstration of free will,\n\n26:54.940 --> 26:56.580\n the demonstration of intelligence,\n\n26:56.580 --> 26:58.500\n the demonstration of consciousness,\n\n26:58.500 --> 27:02.300\n does that equal consciousness, intelligence and free will?\n\n27:02.300 --> 27:07.300\n But see, Alex, if every time I was contemplating a decision,\n\n27:07.580 --> 27:10.220\n you know, this machine had printed out an envelope,\n\n27:10.220 --> 27:11.540\n you know, where I could open it\n\n27:11.540 --> 27:13.220\n and see that it knew my decision,\n\n27:13.220 --> 27:14.700\n I think that actually would change\n\n27:14.700 --> 27:18.180\n my subjective experience of making decisions, right?\n\n27:18.180 --> 27:19.020\n I mean, it would.\n\n27:19.020 --> 27:20.860\n Does knowledge change your subjective experience?\n\n27:20.860 --> 27:22.660\n Well, you know, I mean, the knowledge\n\n27:22.660 --> 27:25.020\n that this machine had predicted everything I would do,\n\n27:25.020 --> 27:27.780\n I mean, it might drive me completely insane, right?\n\n27:27.780 --> 27:30.740\n But at any rate, it would change my experience\n\n27:30.740 --> 27:33.820\n to act, you know, to not just discuss such a machine\n\n27:33.820 --> 27:36.220\n as a thought experiment, but to actually see it.\n\n27:37.140 --> 27:37.980\n Yeah.\n\n27:39.180 --> 27:41.740\n I mean, you know, you could say at that point,\n\n27:41.740 --> 27:43.380\n you know, you could say, you know,\n\n27:43.380 --> 27:45.900\n why not simply call this machine\n\n27:45.900 --> 27:49.180\n a second instantiation of me and be done with it, right?\n\n27:49.180 --> 27:53.460\n What, you know, why even privilege the original me\n\n27:53.460 --> 27:56.940\n over this perfect duplicate that exists in the machine?\n\n27:56.940 --> 28:00.100\n Yeah, or there could be a religious experience with it too.\n\n28:00.100 --> 28:02.460\n It's kind of what God throughout the generations\n\n28:02.460 --> 28:03.780\n is supposed to have.\n\n28:03.780 --> 28:06.860\n That God kind of represents that perfect machine,\n\n28:06.860 --> 28:09.580\n is able to, I guess, actually,\n\n28:10.780 --> 28:14.340\n well, I don't even know what are the religious\n\n28:14.340 --> 28:16.220\n interpretations of free will.\n\n28:17.660 --> 28:22.580\n So if God knows perfectly everything in religion,\n\n28:22.580 --> 28:24.700\n in the various religions,\n\n28:24.700 --> 28:26.580\n where does free will fit into that?\n\n28:26.580 --> 28:27.420\n Do you know?\n\n28:27.420 --> 28:30.220\n That has been one of the big things that theologians\n\n28:30.220 --> 28:32.100\n have argued about for thousands of years.\n\n28:32.100 --> 28:33.420\n Yeah.\n\n28:33.420 --> 28:35.260\n You know, I am not a theologian,\n\n28:35.260 --> 28:36.460\n so maybe I shouldn't go there.\n\n28:36.460 --> 28:38.940\n So there's not a clear answer in a book like...\n\n28:38.940 --> 28:41.940\n I mean, this is, you know, the Calvinists debated this,\n\n28:41.940 --> 28:43.820\n the, you know, this has been, you know,\n\n28:43.820 --> 28:46.180\n I mean, different religious movements\n\n28:46.180 --> 28:48.180\n have taken different positions on that question,\n\n28:48.180 --> 28:50.140\n but that is how they think about it.\n\n28:50.140 --> 28:51.660\n You know, meanwhile, you know,\n\n28:51.660 --> 28:54.700\n a large part of sort of what animates,\n\n28:54.700 --> 28:56.580\n you know, theoretical computer science,\n\n28:56.580 --> 28:58.500\n you could say is, you know, we're asking sort of,\n\n28:58.500 --> 29:01.100\n what are the ultimate limits of, you know,\n\n29:01.100 --> 29:05.540\n what you can know or, you know, calculate or figure out\n\n29:05.540 --> 29:08.180\n by, you know, entities that you can actually build\n\n29:08.180 --> 29:09.740\n in the physical world, right?\n\n29:09.740 --> 29:12.860\n And if I were trying to explain it to a theologian,\n\n29:12.860 --> 29:15.260\n maybe I would say, you know, we are studying, you know,\n\n29:15.260 --> 29:16.460\n to what extent, you know,\n\n29:16.460 --> 29:19.820\n gods can be made manifest in the physical world.\n\n29:19.820 --> 29:21.620\n I'm not sure my colleagues would like that.\n\n29:21.620 --> 29:25.660\n So let's talk about quantum computers for a second.\n\n29:25.660 --> 29:27.340\n Yeah, sure, sure.\n\n29:27.340 --> 29:29.180\n As you've said, quantum computing,\n\n29:29.180 --> 29:32.300\n at least in the 1990s, was a profound story\n\n29:32.300 --> 29:33.940\n at the intersection of computer science,\n\n29:33.940 --> 29:36.340\n physics, engineering, math, and philosophy.\n\n29:36.340 --> 29:40.260\n So there's this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing\n\n29:40.260 --> 29:42.820\n that represents more than just the quantum computer.\n\n29:42.820 --> 29:45.180\n But can we start at the very basics?\n\n29:45.180 --> 29:47.700\n What is quantum computing?\n\n29:47.700 --> 29:52.700\n Yeah, so it's a proposal for a new type of computation,\n\n29:52.700 --> 29:56.580\n or let's say a new way to harness nature to do computation\n\n29:56.580 --> 29:59.700\n that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.\n\n29:59.700 --> 30:01.980\n Okay, now the principles of quantum mechanics\n\n30:01.980 --> 30:05.500\n have been in place since 1926.\n\n30:05.500 --> 30:07.580\n You know, they haven't changed.\n\n30:07.580 --> 30:10.620\n You know, what's new is, you know, how we wanna use them.\n\n30:10.620 --> 30:15.140\n Okay, so what does quantum mechanics say about the world?\n\n30:15.140 --> 30:18.060\n You know, the physicists, I think, over the generations,\n\n30:18.060 --> 30:19.060\n you know, convinced people\n\n30:19.060 --> 30:22.180\n that that is an unbelievably complicated question\n\n30:22.180 --> 30:25.420\n and, you know, just give up on trying to understand it.\n\n30:25.420 --> 30:28.060\n I can let you in, not being a physicist,\n\n30:28.060 --> 30:29.460\n I can let you in on a secret,\n\n30:29.460 --> 30:32.060\n which is that it becomes a lot simpler\n\n30:32.060 --> 30:35.300\n if you do what we do in quantum information theory\n\n30:35.300 --> 30:37.460\n and sort of take the physics out of it.\n\n30:37.460 --> 30:40.780\n So the way that we think about quantum mechanics\n\n30:40.780 --> 30:42.820\n is sort of as a generalization\n\n30:42.820 --> 30:45.300\n of the rules of probability themselves.\n\n30:45.300 --> 30:50.300\n So, you know, you might say there was a 30% chance\n\n30:50.300 --> 30:52.620\n that it was going to snow today or something.\n\n30:52.620 --> 30:55.500\n You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance,\n\n30:55.500 --> 30:57.420\n right, that would be nonsense.\n\n30:57.420 --> 30:59.260\n Much less would you say that there was, you know,\n\n30:59.260 --> 31:03.740\n an I% chance, you know, square root of minus 1% chance.\n\n31:03.740 --> 31:06.100\n Now, the central discovery\n\n31:06.100 --> 31:09.460\n that sort of quantum mechanics made\n\n31:09.460 --> 31:14.460\n is that fundamentally the world is described by,\n\n31:16.420 --> 31:18.780\n or, you know, the sort of, let's say the possibilities\n\n31:18.780 --> 31:21.860\n for, you know, what a system could be doing\n\n31:21.860 --> 31:25.540\n are described using numbers called amplitudes, okay,\n\n31:25.540 --> 31:29.020\n which are like probabilities in some ways,\n\n31:29.020 --> 31:30.780\n but they are not probabilities.\n\n31:30.780 --> 31:31.900\n They can be positive.\n\n31:31.900 --> 31:34.540\n For one thing, they can be positive or negative.\n\n31:34.540 --> 31:37.140\n In fact, they can even be complex numbers.\n\n31:37.140 --> 31:39.980\n Okay, and if you've heard of a quantum superposition,\n\n31:39.980 --> 31:43.180\n this just means some state of affairs\n\n31:43.180 --> 31:45.380\n where you assign an amplitude,\n\n31:45.380 --> 31:47.100\n one of these complex numbers,\n\n31:47.100 --> 31:51.060\n to every possible configuration\n\n31:51.060 --> 31:53.340\n that you could see a system in on measuring it.\n\n31:53.340 --> 31:56.700\n So for example, you might say that an electron\n\n31:56.700 --> 31:59.420\n has some amplitude for being here\n\n31:59.420 --> 32:02.260\n and some other amplitude for being there, right?\n\n32:02.260 --> 32:04.740\n Now, if you look to see where it is,\n\n32:04.740 --> 32:06.460\n you will localize it, right?\n\n32:06.460 --> 32:09.140\n You will sort of force the amplitudes\n\n32:09.140 --> 32:12.220\n to be converted into probabilities.\n\n32:12.220 --> 32:15.300\n That happens by taking their squared absolute value, okay,\n\n32:15.300 --> 32:19.460\n and then, you know, you can say\n\n32:19.460 --> 32:22.580\n either the electron will be here or it will be there.\n\n32:22.580 --> 32:24.180\n And, you know, knowing the amplitudes,\n\n32:24.180 --> 32:26.540\n you can predict at least the probabilities\n\n32:26.540 --> 32:29.900\n that you'll see each possible outcome, okay?\n\n32:29.900 --> 32:32.540\n But while a system is isolated\n\n32:32.540 --> 32:34.660\n from the whole rest of the universe,\n\n32:34.660 --> 32:36.380\n the rest of its environment,\n\n32:36.380 --> 32:38.820\n the amplitudes can change in time\n\n32:38.820 --> 32:41.380\n by rules that are different\n\n32:41.380 --> 32:44.420\n from the normal rules of probability\n\n32:44.420 --> 32:47.540\n and that are, you know, alien to our everyday experience.\n\n32:47.540 --> 32:50.420\n So anytime anyone ever tells you anything\n\n32:50.420 --> 32:52.620\n about the weirdness of the quantum world,\n\n32:52.620 --> 32:55.940\n you know, or assuming that they're not lying to you, right,\n\n32:55.940 --> 32:57.780\n they are telling you, you know,\n\n32:57.780 --> 33:00.140\n yet another consequence of nature\n\n33:00.140 --> 33:03.060\n being described by these amplitudes.\n\n33:03.060 --> 33:05.860\n So most famously, what amplitudes can do\n\n33:05.860 --> 33:08.060\n is that they can interfere with each other, okay?\n\n33:08.060 --> 33:11.300\n So in the famous double slit experiment,\n\n33:11.300 --> 33:13.580\n what happens is that you shoot a particle,\n\n33:13.580 --> 33:15.300\n like an electron, let's say,\n\n33:15.300 --> 33:17.540\n at a screen with two slits in it,\n\n33:17.540 --> 33:21.020\n and you find that there are, you know, on a second screen,\n\n33:21.020 --> 33:22.660\n now there are certain places\n\n33:22.660 --> 33:25.020\n where that electron will never end up,\n\n33:25.020 --> 33:29.420\n you know, after it passes through the first screen.\n\n33:29.420 --> 33:32.460\n And yet, if I close off one of the slits,\n\n33:32.460 --> 33:35.300\n then the electron can appear in that place, okay?\n\n33:35.300 --> 33:38.020\n So by decreasing the number of paths\n\n33:38.020 --> 33:40.540\n that the electron could take to get somewhere,\n\n33:40.540 --> 33:43.260\n you can increase the chance that it gets there, okay?\n\n33:43.260 --> 33:45.140\n Now, how is that possible?\n\n33:45.140 --> 33:48.580\n Well, it's because, you know, as we would say now,\n\n33:48.580 --> 33:51.620\n the electron has a superposition state, okay?\n\n33:51.620 --> 33:54.860\n It has some amplitude for reaching this point\n\n33:54.860 --> 33:57.620\n by going through the first slit.\n\n33:57.620 --> 33:59.660\n It has some other amplitude for reaching it\n\n33:59.660 --> 34:01.500\n by going through the second slit.\n\n34:01.500 --> 34:03.820\n But now, if one amplitude is positive\n\n34:03.820 --> 34:05.540\n and the other one is negative,\n\n34:05.540 --> 34:07.860\n then, you know, I have to add them all up, right?\n\n34:07.860 --> 34:10.620\n I have to add the amplitudes for every path\n\n34:10.620 --> 34:13.620\n that the electron could have taken to reach this point.\n\n34:13.620 --> 34:15.540\n And those amplitudes,\n\n34:15.540 --> 34:17.620\n if they're pointing in different directions,\n\n34:17.620 --> 34:19.540\n they can cancel each other out.\n\n34:19.540 --> 34:21.940\n That would mean the total amplitude is zero\n\n34:21.940 --> 34:24.060\n and the thing never happens at all.\n\n34:24.060 --> 34:26.180\n I close off one of the possibilities,\n\n34:26.180 --> 34:28.620\n then the amplitude is positive or it's negative,\n\n34:28.620 --> 34:30.300\n and now the thing can happen.\n\n34:30.300 --> 34:33.900\n Okay, so that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics.\n\n34:33.900 --> 34:36.620\n And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is.\n\n34:36.620 --> 34:41.060\n Okay, a quantum computer is a computer\n\n34:41.060 --> 34:45.460\n that tries to exploit, you know, exactly these phenomena,\n\n34:45.460 --> 34:48.940\n superposition, amplitudes, and interference,\n\n34:48.940 --> 34:52.060\n in order to solve certain problems much faster\n\n34:52.060 --> 34:54.260\n than we know how to solve them otherwise.\n\n34:54.260 --> 34:56.740\n So the basic building block of a quantum computer\n\n34:56.740 --> 34:59.940\n is what we call a quantum bit or a qubit.\n\n34:59.940 --> 35:03.460\n That just means a bit that has some amplitude for being zero\n\n35:03.460 --> 35:05.860\n and some other amplitude for being one.\n\n35:05.860 --> 35:09.260\n So it's a superposition of zero and one states, right?\n\n35:09.260 --> 35:12.300\n But now the key point is that if I've got,\n\n35:12.300 --> 35:14.740\n let's say, a thousand qubits,\n\n35:14.740 --> 35:18.060\n the rules of quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal\n\n35:18.060 --> 35:20.340\n that I do not just need one ampli...\n\n35:20.340 --> 35:23.540\n You know, I don't just need amplitudes for each qubit separately.\n\n35:23.540 --> 35:26.100\n Okay, in general, I need an amplitude\n\n35:26.100 --> 35:30.780\n for every possible setting of all thousand of those bits, okay?\n\n35:30.780 --> 35:34.900\n So that what that means is two to the one thousand power amplitudes.\n\n35:34.900 --> 35:37.620\n Okay, if I had to write those down,\n\n35:37.620 --> 35:40.420\n or let's say in the memory of a conventional computer,\n\n35:40.420 --> 35:43.740\n if I had to write down two to the one thousand complex numbers,\n\n35:43.740 --> 35:47.340\n that would not fit within the entire observable universe.\n\n35:47.340 --> 35:50.860\n Okay, and yet, you know, quantum mechanics is unequivocal\n\n35:50.860 --> 35:53.860\n that if these qubits can all interact with each other,\n\n35:53.860 --> 35:58.020\n and in some sense, I need two to the one thousand parameters,\n\n35:58.020 --> 36:01.180\n you know, amplitudes to describe what is going on.\n\n36:01.180 --> 36:05.900\n Now, you know, now I can tell, you know, where all the popular articles,\n\n36:05.900 --> 36:08.380\n you know, about quantum computing go off the rails\n\n36:08.380 --> 36:11.860\n is that they say, you know, they sort of say what I just said,\n\n36:11.860 --> 36:14.620\n and then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer works\n\n36:14.620 --> 36:17.900\n is just by trying every possible answer in parallel.\n\n36:17.900 --> 36:21.020\n You know, that sounds too good to be true,\n\n36:21.020 --> 36:24.620\n and unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true.\n\n36:24.620 --> 36:27.980\n The problem is I could make a superposition\n\n36:27.980 --> 36:31.340\n over every possible answer to my problem, you know,\n\n36:31.340 --> 36:34.060\n even if there are two to the one thousand of them, right?\n\n36:34.060 --> 36:35.740\n I can easily do that.\n\n36:35.740 --> 36:38.140\n The trouble is for a computer to be useful,\n\n36:38.140 --> 36:40.300\n you've got to, at some point, you've got to look at it\n\n36:40.300 --> 36:42.380\n and see an output, right?\n\n36:42.380 --> 36:46.700\n And if I just measure a superposition over every possible answer,\n\n36:46.700 --> 36:48.620\n then the rules of quantum mechanics tell me\n\n36:48.620 --> 36:51.340\n that all I'll see will be a random answer.\n\n36:51.340 --> 36:53.020\n You know, if I just wanted a random answer,\n\n36:53.020 --> 36:56.300\n well, I could have picked one myself with a lot less trouble, right?\n\n36:56.300 --> 36:59.980\n So the entire trick with quantum computing,\n\n36:59.980 --> 37:02.780\n with every algorithm for a quantum computer,\n\n37:02.780 --> 37:05.740\n is that you try to choreograph a pattern\n\n37:05.740 --> 37:08.380\n of interference of amplitudes,\n\n37:08.380 --> 37:11.500\n and you try to do it so that for each wrong answer,\n\n37:11.500 --> 37:14.060\n some of the paths leading to that wrong answer\n\n37:14.060 --> 37:17.900\n have positive amplitudes and others have negative amplitudes.\n\n37:17.900 --> 37:20.540\n So on the whole, they cancel each other out, okay?\n\n37:20.540 --> 37:23.420\n Whereas all the paths leading to the right answer\n\n37:23.420 --> 37:26.620\n should reinforce each other, you know, should have amplitudes\n\n37:26.620 --> 37:28.060\n pointing the same direction.\n\n37:28.060 --> 37:30.700\n So the design of algorithms in the space\n\n37:30.700 --> 37:33.100\n is the choreography of the interferences.\n\n37:33.100 --> 37:35.020\n Precisely. That's precisely what it is.\n\n37:35.020 --> 37:36.700\n Can we take a brief step back?\n\n37:36.700 --> 37:39.820\n And you mentioned information.\n\n37:39.820 --> 37:40.380\n Yes.\n\n37:40.380 --> 37:43.180\n So in which part of this beautiful picture\n\n37:43.180 --> 37:46.620\n that you've painted is information contained?\n\n37:46.620 --> 37:49.500\n Oh, well, information is at the core of everything\n\n37:49.500 --> 37:51.020\n that we've been talking about, right?\n\n37:51.020 --> 37:55.260\n I mean, the bit is, you know, the basic unit of information\n\n37:55.260 --> 37:58.940\n since, you know, Claude Shannon's paper in 1948.\n\n37:58.940 --> 38:00.140\n You know, and, you know, of course, you know,\n\n38:00.140 --> 38:02.460\n people had the concept even before that, you know,\n\n38:02.460 --> 38:05.100\n he popularized the name, right?\n\n38:05.100 --> 38:05.740\n But I mean...\n\n38:05.740 --> 38:07.740\n But a bit is zero or one.\n\n38:07.740 --> 38:08.220\n That's right.\n\n38:08.220 --> 38:08.940\n So that's a basic element of information.\n\n38:08.940 --> 38:09.420\n That's right.\n\n38:09.420 --> 38:11.740\n And what we would say is that the basic unit\n\n38:11.740 --> 38:14.540\n of quantum information is the qubit,\n\n38:14.540 --> 38:16.940\n is, you know, the object, any object\n\n38:16.940 --> 38:20.860\n that can be maintained in this, or manipulated,\n\n38:20.860 --> 38:23.260\n in a superposition of zero and one states.\n\n38:24.060 --> 38:26.380\n Now, you know, sometimes people ask, well,\n\n38:26.380 --> 38:29.020\n but what is a qubit physically, right?\n\n38:29.020 --> 38:31.260\n And there are all these different, you know,\n\n38:32.220 --> 38:34.700\n proposals that are being pursued in parallel\n\n38:34.700 --> 38:36.860\n for how you implement qubits.\n\n38:36.860 --> 38:39.660\n There is, you know, superconducting quantum computing\n\n38:39.660 --> 38:41.420\n that was in the news recently\n\n38:41.420 --> 38:44.940\n because of Google's quantum supremacy experiment, right?\n\n38:44.940 --> 38:49.500\n Where you would have some little coils\n\n38:49.500 --> 38:52.220\n where a current can flow through them\n\n38:52.220 --> 38:54.300\n in two different energy states,\n\n38:54.300 --> 38:57.500\n one representing a zero, another representing a one.\n\n38:57.500 --> 38:59.180\n And if you cool these coils\n\n38:59.180 --> 39:02.060\n to just slightly above absolute zero,\n\n39:02.060 --> 39:05.500\n like a hundredth of a degree, then they superconduct.\n\n39:05.500 --> 39:07.260\n And then the current can actually be\n\n39:07.260 --> 39:09.420\n in a superposition of the two different states.\n\n39:10.620 --> 39:12.300\n So that's one kind of qubit.\n\n39:12.300 --> 39:14.460\n Another kind would be, you know,\n\n39:14.460 --> 39:17.660\n just an individual atomic nucleus, right?\n\n39:17.660 --> 39:18.940\n It has a spin.\n\n39:18.940 --> 39:20.940\n It could be spinning clockwise.\n\n39:20.940 --> 39:23.020\n It could be spinning counterclockwise,\n\n39:23.020 --> 39:25.980\n or it could be in a superposition of the two spin states.\n\n39:25.980 --> 39:27.420\n That is another qubit.\n\n39:27.420 --> 39:30.220\n But see, just like in the classical world, right?\n\n39:30.220 --> 39:32.780\n You could be a virtuoso programmer\n\n39:32.780 --> 39:36.300\n without having any idea of what a transistor is, right?\n\n39:36.300 --> 39:40.380\n Or how the bits are physically represented inside the machine,\n\n39:40.380 --> 39:43.180\n even that the machine uses electricity, right?\n\n39:43.180 --> 39:44.940\n You just care about the logic.\n\n39:44.940 --> 39:47.260\n It's sort of the same with quantum computing, right?\n\n39:47.260 --> 39:49.420\n Qubits could be realized by many,\n\n39:49.420 --> 39:51.260\n many different quantum systems.\n\n39:51.260 --> 39:54.380\n And yet all of those systems will lead to the same logic,\n\n39:54.380 --> 39:58.540\n you know, the logic of qubits and how, you know,\n\n39:58.540 --> 40:01.420\n how you measure them, how you change them over time.\n\n40:01.420 --> 40:03.980\n And so, you know, the subject of, you know,\n\n40:03.980 --> 40:07.420\n how qubits behave and what you can do with qubits,\n\n40:07.420 --> 40:09.260\n that is quantum information.\n\n40:09.260 --> 40:10.940\n So just to linger on that.\n\n40:10.940 --> 40:11.260\n Sure.\n\n40:11.260 --> 40:14.380\n So the physical design implementation of a qubit\n\n40:14.380 --> 40:18.700\n does not interfere with the,\n\n40:18.700 --> 40:22.380\n that next level of abstraction that you can program over it.\n\n40:22.380 --> 40:27.020\n So it truly is, the idea of it is, okay.\n\n40:27.020 --> 40:28.780\n Well, to be honest with you,\n\n40:28.780 --> 40:30.700\n today they do interfere with each other.\n\n40:30.700 --> 40:32.860\n That's because all the quantum computers\n\n40:32.860 --> 40:35.420\n we can build today are very noisy, right?\n\n40:35.420 --> 40:37.820\n And so sort of the, you know,\n\n40:37.820 --> 40:40.940\n the qubits are very far from perfect.\n\n40:40.940 --> 40:43.900\n And so the lower level sort of does affect the higher levels.\n\n40:43.900 --> 40:46.380\n And we sort of have to think about all of them at once.\n\n40:46.380 --> 40:49.180\n Okay, but eventually where we hope to get\n\n40:49.180 --> 40:52.460\n is to what are called error corrected quantum computers,\n\n40:52.460 --> 40:54.540\n where the qubits really do behave\n\n40:54.540 --> 40:58.780\n like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them to.\n\n40:58.780 --> 41:00.380\n And in that future, you know,\n\n41:01.500 --> 41:04.940\n a future that we can already sort of prove theorems about\n\n41:04.940 --> 41:06.380\n or think about today.\n\n41:06.380 --> 41:09.500\n But in that future, the logic of it\n\n41:09.500 --> 41:11.980\n really does become decoupled from the hardware.\n\n41:11.980 --> 41:15.580\n So if noise is currently like the biggest problem\n\n41:16.300 --> 41:18.220\n for quantum computing,\n\n41:18.220 --> 41:23.020\n and then the dream is error correcting quantum computers,\n\n41:23.020 --> 41:26.620\n can you just maybe describe what does it mean\n\n41:26.620 --> 41:28.780\n for there to be noise in the system?\n\n41:28.780 --> 41:31.020\n Absolutely, so yeah, so the problem\n\n41:31.020 --> 41:33.100\n is even a little more specific than noise.\n\n41:33.100 --> 41:35.260\n So the fundamental problem,\n\n41:35.260 --> 41:38.380\n if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer,\n\n41:38.380 --> 41:41.260\n you know, of any appreciable size,\n\n41:41.260 --> 41:43.660\n is something called decoherence.\n\n41:43.660 --> 41:46.220\n Okay, and this was recognized from the very beginning,\n\n41:46.220 --> 41:48.460\n you know, when people first started thinking about this\n\n41:48.460 --> 41:49.980\n in the 1990s.\n\n41:49.980 --> 41:52.620\n Now, what decoherence means\n\n41:52.620 --> 41:54.780\n is sort of the unwanted interaction\n\n41:54.780 --> 41:56.860\n between, you know, your qubits,\n\n41:56.860 --> 41:59.180\n you know, the state of your quantum computer\n\n41:59.180 --> 42:01.100\n and the external environment.\n\n42:01.100 --> 42:03.100\n Okay, and why is that such a problem?\n\n42:03.100 --> 42:05.180\n Well, I talked before about how, you know,\n\n42:05.180 --> 42:07.660\n when you measure a quantum system,\n\n42:07.660 --> 42:09.900\n so let's say if I measure a qubit\n\n42:09.900 --> 42:12.140\n that's in a superposition of zero and one states\n\n42:12.140 --> 42:14.620\n to ask it, you know, are you zero or are you one?\n\n42:14.620 --> 42:17.100\n Well, now I force it to make up its mind, right?\n\n42:17.100 --> 42:20.860\n And now, probabilistically, it chooses one or the other\n\n42:20.860 --> 42:23.260\n and now, you know, it's no longer a superposition,\n\n42:23.260 --> 42:25.020\n there's no longer amplitudes,\n\n42:25.020 --> 42:27.500\n there's just, there's some probability that I get a zero\n\n42:27.500 --> 42:29.180\n and there's some that I get a one.\n\n42:29.180 --> 42:35.180\n And now, the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me\n\n42:35.180 --> 42:36.300\n who's looking, okay?\n\n42:36.300 --> 42:40.380\n Or in fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity.\n\n42:40.380 --> 42:44.220\n Any kind of interaction with the external world\n\n42:44.220 --> 42:46.620\n that leaks out the information\n\n42:46.620 --> 42:49.900\n about whether this qubit was a zero or a one,\n\n42:49.900 --> 42:52.380\n sort of that causes the zerowness\n\n42:52.380 --> 42:55.740\n or the oneness of the qubit to be recorded\n\n42:55.740 --> 42:58.220\n in, you know, the radiation in the room,\n\n42:58.220 --> 43:00.540\n in the molecules of the air,\n\n43:00.540 --> 43:03.900\n in the wires that are connected to my device,\n\n43:03.900 --> 43:07.900\n any of that, as soon as the information leaks out,\n\n43:07.900 --> 43:11.020\n it is as if that qubit has been measured, okay?\n\n43:11.020 --> 43:14.460\n It is, you know, the state has now collapsed.\n\n43:15.020 --> 43:16.220\n You know, another way to say it\n\n43:16.220 --> 43:19.340\n is that it's become entangled with its environment, okay?\n\n43:19.340 --> 43:21.740\n But, you know, from the perspective of someone\n\n43:21.740 --> 43:23.420\n who's just looking at this qubit,\n\n43:23.420 --> 43:26.700\n it is as though it has lost its quantum state.\n\n43:26.700 --> 43:28.540\n And so, what this means is that\n\n43:28.540 --> 43:31.660\n if I want to do a quantum computation,\n\n43:31.660 --> 43:34.780\n I have to keep the qubits sort of fanatically\n\n43:34.780 --> 43:37.340\n well isolated from their environment.\n\n43:37.340 --> 43:38.540\n But then at the same time,\n\n43:38.540 --> 43:40.300\n they can't be perfectly isolated\n\n43:40.300 --> 43:42.460\n because I need to tell them what to do.\n\n43:42.460 --> 43:45.100\n I need to make them interact with each other,\n\n43:45.100 --> 43:46.940\n for one thing, and not only that,\n\n43:46.940 --> 43:50.060\n but in a precisely choreographed way, okay?\n\n43:50.060 --> 43:53.420\n And, you know, that is such a staggering problem, right?\n\n43:53.420 --> 43:56.300\n How do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe\n\n43:56.300 --> 43:58.700\n but then also tell them exactly what to do?\n\n43:58.700 --> 44:01.420\n I mean, you know, there were distinguished physicists\n\n44:01.420 --> 44:04.620\n and computer scientists in the 90s who said,\n\n44:04.620 --> 44:07.020\n this is fundamentally impossible, you know?\n\n44:07.020 --> 44:10.540\n The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits\n\n44:10.540 --> 44:13.260\n to the degree of accuracy that you're talking about.\n\n44:14.140 --> 44:17.660\n Now, what changed the views of most of us\n\n44:17.660 --> 44:22.300\n was a profound discovery in the mid to late 90s\n\n44:22.300 --> 44:25.340\n which was called the theory of quantum error correction\n\n44:25.340 --> 44:27.580\n and quantum fault tolerance, okay?\n\n44:27.580 --> 44:29.980\n And the upshot of that theory is that\n\n44:29.980 --> 44:33.500\n if I want to build a reliable quantum computer\n\n44:33.500 --> 44:36.300\n and scale it up to, you know, an arbitrary number\n\n44:36.300 --> 44:38.540\n of as many qubits as I want, you know,\n\n44:38.540 --> 44:40.620\n and doing as much on them as I want,\n\n44:41.180 --> 44:43.580\n I do not actually have to get the qubits\n\n44:43.580 --> 44:46.060\n perfectly isolated from their environment.\n\n44:46.060 --> 44:50.060\n It is enough to get them really, really, really well isolated, okay?\n\n44:50.060 --> 44:54.620\n And even if every qubit is sort of leaking,\n\n44:54.620 --> 44:57.820\n you know, its state into the environment at some rate,\n\n44:57.820 --> 45:00.460\n as long as that rate is low enough, okay,\n\n45:00.460 --> 45:04.380\n I can sort of encode the information that I care about\n\n45:05.100 --> 45:08.300\n in very clever ways across the collective states\n\n45:08.300 --> 45:10.140\n of multiple qubits, okay?\n\n45:10.140 --> 45:12.380\n In such a way that even if, you know,\n\n45:12.380 --> 45:14.940\n a small percentage of my qubits leak,\n\n45:14.940 --> 45:16.860\n well, I'm constantly monitoring them\n\n45:16.860 --> 45:18.380\n to see if that leak happened.\n\n45:18.380 --> 45:20.940\n I can detect it and I can correct it.\n\n45:20.940 --> 45:23.340\n I can recover the information I care about\n\n45:23.340 --> 45:25.500\n from the remaining qubits, okay?\n\n45:25.500 --> 45:30.300\n And so, you know, you can build a reliable quantum computer\n\n45:30.300 --> 45:32.700\n even out of unreliable parts, right?\n\n45:32.700 --> 45:35.740\n Now, in some sense, you know,\n\n45:35.740 --> 45:39.100\n that discovery is what set the engineering agenda\n\n45:39.100 --> 45:41.020\n for quantum computing research\n\n45:41.020 --> 45:43.660\n from the 1990s until the present, okay?\n\n45:43.660 --> 45:45.420\n The goal has been, you know,\n\n45:45.420 --> 45:48.940\n engineer qubits that are not perfectly reliable\n\n45:48.940 --> 45:51.900\n but reliable enough that you can then use\n\n45:51.900 --> 45:53.820\n these error correcting codes\n\n45:53.820 --> 45:56.140\n to have them simulate qubits\n\n45:56.140 --> 45:58.940\n that are even more reliable than they are, right?\n\n45:58.940 --> 46:01.020\n The error correction becomes a net win\n\n46:01.020 --> 46:02.860\n rather than a net loss, right?\n\n46:02.860 --> 46:05.900\n And then once you reach that sort of crossover point,\n\n46:05.900 --> 46:08.220\n then, you know, your simulated qubits\n\n46:08.220 --> 46:10.140\n could in turn simulate qubits\n\n46:10.140 --> 46:12.460\n that are even more reliable and so on\n\n46:12.460 --> 46:14.540\n until you've just, you know, effectively,\n\n46:14.540 --> 46:17.020\n you have arbitrarily reliable qubits.\n\n46:17.020 --> 46:18.140\n So long story short,\n\n46:18.140 --> 46:20.620\n we are not at that breakeven point yet.\n\n46:20.620 --> 46:22.540\n We're a hell of a lot closer than we were\n\n46:22.540 --> 46:24.700\n when people started doing this in the 90s,\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:26.300\n like orders of magnitude closer.\n\n46:26.300 --> 46:27.580\n But the key ingredient there\n\n46:27.580 --> 46:30.300\n is the more qubits, the better because...\n\n46:30.300 --> 46:32.060\n Ah, well, the more qubits,\n\n46:32.060 --> 46:35.100\n the larger the computation you can do, right?\n\n46:35.100 --> 46:38.060\n I mean, qubits are what constitute\n\n46:38.060 --> 46:40.300\n the memory of your quantum computer, right?\n\n46:40.300 --> 46:41.580\n But also for the, sorry,\n\n46:41.580 --> 46:43.100\n for the error correcting mechanism.\n\n46:43.100 --> 46:43.660\n Ah, yes.\n\n46:44.540 --> 46:45.980\n So the way I would say it\n\n46:45.980 --> 46:48.780\n is that error correction imposes an overhead\n\n46:48.780 --> 46:50.220\n in the number of qubits.\n\n46:50.220 --> 46:53.260\n And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems\n\n46:53.260 --> 46:55.500\n with building a scalable quantum computer.\n\n46:55.500 --> 46:57.900\n If you look at the error correcting codes,\n\n46:57.900 --> 47:00.380\n at least the ones that we know about today,\n\n47:00.380 --> 47:01.340\n and you look at, you know,\n\n47:01.340 --> 47:04.460\n what would it take to actually use a quantum computer\n\n47:04.460 --> 47:09.100\n to, you know, hack your credit card number,\n\n47:09.100 --> 47:10.060\n which is, you know,\n\n47:10.060 --> 47:11.980\n maybe, you know, the most famous application\n\n47:11.980 --> 47:13.180\n people talk about, right?\n\n47:13.180 --> 47:15.180\n Let's say to factor huge numbers\n\n47:15.180 --> 47:17.900\n and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem.\n\n47:17.900 --> 47:19.420\n Well, what that would take\n\n47:19.420 --> 47:23.980\n would be thousands of, several thousand logical qubits.\n\n47:23.980 --> 47:26.460\n But now with the known error correcting codes,\n\n47:26.460 --> 47:28.220\n each of those logical qubits\n\n47:28.220 --> 47:29.980\n would need to be encoded itself\n\n47:29.980 --> 47:32.220\n using thousands of physical qubits.\n\n47:32.220 --> 47:32.940\n So at that point,\n\n47:32.940 --> 47:35.740\n you're talking about millions of physical qubits.\n\n47:35.740 --> 47:36.620\n And in some sense,\n\n47:36.620 --> 47:38.860\n that is the reason why quantum computers\n\n47:38.860 --> 47:40.780\n are not breaking cryptography already.\n\n47:40.780 --> 47:43.740\n It's because of these immense overheads involved.\n\n47:43.740 --> 47:46.300\n So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?\n\n47:46.300 --> 47:47.420\n Well, it's multiplicative.\n\n47:47.420 --> 47:49.580\n I mean, it's like you take the number\n\n47:49.580 --> 47:52.460\n of logical qubits that you need\n\n47:52.460 --> 47:54.380\n in your abstract quantum circuit,\n\n47:54.380 --> 47:56.700\n you multiply it by a thousand or so.\n\n47:56.700 --> 47:58.220\n So, you know, there's a lot of work\n\n47:58.220 --> 47:59.900\n on, you know, inventing better,\n\n47:59.900 --> 48:02.220\n trying to invent better error correcting codes.\n\n48:02.220 --> 48:04.140\n Okay, that is the situation right now.\n\n48:04.140 --> 48:06.700\n In the meantime, we are now in,\n\n48:07.420 --> 48:09.580\n what the physicist John Preskill called\n\n48:09.580 --> 48:13.420\n the noisy intermediate scale quantum or NISQ era.\n\n48:13.420 --> 48:14.540\n And this is the era,\n\n48:14.540 --> 48:16.780\n you can think of it as sort of like the vacuum,\n\n48:16.780 --> 48:19.020\n you know, we're now entering the very early\n\n48:19.020 --> 48:21.740\n vacuum tube era of quantum computers.\n\n48:21.740 --> 48:24.700\n The quantum computer analog of the transistor\n\n48:24.700 --> 48:26.460\n has not been invented yet, right?\n\n48:26.460 --> 48:29.020\n That would be like true error correction, right?\n\n48:29.020 --> 48:31.420\n Where, you know, we are not or something else\n\n48:31.420 --> 48:33.420\n that would achieve the same effect, right?\n\n48:33.420 --> 48:34.540\n We are not there yet.\n\n48:37.020 --> 48:38.300\n But where we are now,\n\n48:38.300 --> 48:40.140\n let's say as of a few months ago,\n\n48:40.140 --> 48:41.980\n you know, as of Google's announcement\n\n48:41.980 --> 48:43.500\n of quantum supremacy,\n\n48:43.500 --> 48:45.660\n you know, we are now finally at the point\n\n48:45.660 --> 48:49.260\n where even with a non error corrected quantum computer,\n\n48:49.260 --> 48:51.260\n with, you know, these noisy devices,\n\n48:51.260 --> 48:53.740\n we can do something that is hard\n\n48:53.740 --> 48:56.380\n for classical computers to simulate, okay?\n\n48:56.380 --> 48:58.620\n So we can eke out some advantage.\n\n48:58.620 --> 49:00.620\n Now, will we in this noisy era\n\n49:00.620 --> 49:02.620\n be able to do something beyond\n\n49:02.620 --> 49:04.140\n what a classical computer can do\n\n49:04.140 --> 49:06.380\n that is also useful to someone?\n\n49:06.380 --> 49:07.660\n That we still don't know.\n\n49:07.660 --> 49:10.460\n People are going to be racing over the next decade\n\n49:10.460 --> 49:11.420\n to try to do that.\n\n49:11.420 --> 49:13.580\n By people, I mean, Google, IBM,\n\n49:13.580 --> 49:16.220\n you know, a bunch of startup companies.\n\n49:16.220 --> 49:18.540\n And research labs.\n\n49:18.540 --> 49:21.180\n Yeah, and research labs and governments.\n\n49:21.180 --> 49:22.460\n And yeah.\n\n49:22.460 --> 49:23.980\n You just mentioned a million things.\n\n49:23.980 --> 49:25.580\n Well, I'll backtrack for a second.\n\n49:25.580 --> 49:26.380\n Yeah, sure, sure.\n\n49:27.100 --> 49:29.580\n So we're in these vacuum tube days.\n\n49:29.580 --> 49:31.020\n Yeah, just entering them.\n\n49:31.020 --> 49:32.860\n And just entering, wow.\n\n49:32.860 --> 49:36.380\n Okay, so how do we escape the vacuum?\n\n49:36.380 --> 49:37.580\n So how do we get to,\n\n49:39.500 --> 49:42.140\n how do we get to where we are now with the CPU?\n\n49:42.140 --> 49:44.700\n Is this a fundamental engineering challenge?\n\n49:44.700 --> 49:49.020\n Is there breakthroughs on the physics side\n\n49:49.020 --> 49:52.220\n that are needed on the computer science side?\n\n49:53.180 --> 49:56.060\n Or is it a financial issue\n\n49:56.060 --> 49:59.420\n where much larger just sheer investment\n\n49:59.420 --> 50:01.020\n and excitement is needed?\n\n50:01.020 --> 50:03.660\n So, you know, those are excellent questions.\n\n50:03.660 --> 50:05.740\n My guess might, well, no, no.\n\n50:05.740 --> 50:09.260\n My guess would be all of the above.\n\n50:09.260 --> 50:11.020\n I mean, my guess, you know,\n\n50:11.020 --> 50:13.420\n I mean, you could say fundamentally\n\n50:13.420 --> 50:15.100\n it is an engineering issue, right?\n\n50:15.100 --> 50:17.980\n The theory has been in place since the 90s.\n\n50:17.980 --> 50:21.100\n You know, at least, you know, this is what,\n\n50:21.100 --> 50:23.340\n you know, error correction would look like.\n\n50:23.340 --> 50:25.420\n You know, we do not have the hardware\n\n50:25.420 --> 50:26.780\n that is at that level.\n\n50:26.780 --> 50:28.380\n But at the same time, you know,\n\n50:28.380 --> 50:32.220\n so you could just, you know, try to power through,\n\n50:32.220 --> 50:34.220\n you know, maybe even like, you know,\n\n50:34.220 --> 50:36.540\n if someone spent a trillion dollars\n\n50:36.540 --> 50:39.420\n on some quantum computing Manhattan project, right?\n\n50:39.420 --> 50:43.020\n Then conceivably they could just, you know,\n\n50:43.020 --> 50:46.540\n build an error corrected quantum computer\n\n50:46.540 --> 50:49.580\n as it was envisioned back in the 90s, right?\n\n50:49.580 --> 50:52.460\n I think the more plausible thing to happen\n\n50:52.460 --> 50:55.420\n is that there will be further theoretical breakthroughs\n\n50:55.420 --> 50:57.340\n and there will be further insights\n\n50:57.340 --> 50:59.900\n that will cut down the cost of doing this.\n\n50:59.900 --> 51:02.940\n So let's take a brief step to the philosophical.\n\n51:02.940 --> 51:05.420\n I just recently talked to Jim Keller\n\n51:05.420 --> 51:09.660\n who's sort of like the famed architect\n\n51:09.660 --> 51:11.660\n in the microprocessor world.\n\n51:12.220 --> 51:15.820\n And he's been told for decades,\n\n51:16.380 --> 51:19.820\n every year that the Moore's law is going to die this year.\n\n51:20.460 --> 51:24.220\n And he tries to argue that the Moore's law\n\n51:24.220 --> 51:25.580\n is still alive and well,\n\n51:25.580 --> 51:27.740\n and it'll be alive for quite a long time to come.\n\n51:28.380 --> 51:29.020\n How long?\n\n51:29.020 --> 51:30.060\n How long did he say?\n\n51:30.060 --> 51:33.660\n Well, the main point is it's still alive,\n\n51:33.660 --> 51:38.140\n but he thinks there's still a thousand X improvement\n\n51:38.140 --> 51:40.380\n just on shrinking the transition that's possible.\n\n51:40.940 --> 51:41.420\n Whatever.\n\n51:41.420 --> 51:44.780\n The point is that the exponential growth we see\n\n51:45.420 --> 51:49.100\n is actually a huge number of these S curves,\n\n51:49.740 --> 51:51.100\n just constant breakthroughs.\n\n51:51.660 --> 51:53.260\n At the philosophical level,\n\n51:53.820 --> 51:57.980\n why do you think we as descendants of apes\n\n51:57.980 --> 52:00.540\n were able to just keep coming up\n\n52:00.540 --> 52:03.500\n with these new breakthroughs on the CPU side\n\n52:03.500 --> 52:06.940\n is this something unique to this particular endeavor\n\n52:06.940 --> 52:09.660\n or will it be possible to replicate\n\n52:09.660 --> 52:11.100\n in the quantum computer space?\n\n52:11.660 --> 52:11.980\n Okay.\n\n52:11.980 --> 52:12.780\n All right.\n\n52:12.780 --> 52:13.660\n There was a lot there,\n\n52:15.340 --> 52:17.660\n but to break off something,\n\n52:17.660 --> 52:20.860\n I mean, I think we are in an extremely special period\n\n52:20.860 --> 52:22.460\n of human history, right?\n\n52:22.460 --> 52:24.780\n I mean, it is, you could say,\n\n52:24.780 --> 52:28.220\n obviously special in many ways, right?\n\n52:28.220 --> 52:31.740\n There are way more people alive\n\n52:31.740 --> 52:33.420\n than there have been\n\n52:33.420 --> 52:39.740\n and the whole future of the planet\n\n52:39.740 --> 52:43.660\n is in question in a way that it hasn't been\n\n52:44.460 --> 52:46.620\n for the rest of human history.\n\n52:46.620 --> 52:51.100\n But in particular, we are in the era\n\n52:51.100 --> 52:53.900\n where we finally figured out\n\n52:53.900 --> 52:57.580\n how to build universal machines,\n\n52:57.580 --> 53:00.460\n you could say, the things that we call computers,\n\n53:00.460 --> 53:04.780\n machines that you program to simulate the behavior\n\n53:04.780 --> 53:06.460\n of whatever machine you want.\n\n53:07.020 --> 53:13.420\n And once you've sort of crossed this threshold\n\n53:13.420 --> 53:15.900\n of universality, you've built,\n\n53:15.900 --> 53:17.260\n you could say, touring,\n\n53:17.260 --> 53:19.500\n you've instantiated touring machines\n\n53:19.500 --> 53:20.780\n in the physical world.\n\n53:20.780 --> 53:23.900\n Well, then the main questions are ones of numbers.\n\n53:23.900 --> 53:29.500\n They are ones of how much memory can you access?\n\n53:29.500 --> 53:31.100\n How fast does it run?\n\n53:31.100 --> 53:33.260\n How many parallel processors?\n\n53:33.260 --> 53:34.780\n At least until quantum computing.\n\n53:34.780 --> 53:36.300\n Quantum computing is the one thing\n\n53:36.300 --> 53:38.540\n that changes what I just said, right?\n\n53:38.540 --> 53:42.380\n But as long as it's classical computing,\n\n53:42.380 --> 53:44.700\n then it's all questions of numbers.\n\n53:44.700 --> 53:48.700\n And you could say at a theoretical level,\n\n53:48.700 --> 53:50.380\n the computers that we have today\n\n53:50.380 --> 53:52.620\n are the same as the ones in the 50s.\n\n53:52.620 --> 53:55.500\n They're just millions of times faster\n\n53:55.500 --> 53:57.260\n and with millions of times more memory.\n\n53:57.260 --> 54:01.500\n And I think there's been an immense economic pressure\n\n54:01.500 --> 54:04.220\n to get more and more transistors,\n\n54:04.780 --> 54:06.300\n get them smaller and smaller,\n\n54:07.100 --> 54:08.460\n add more and more cores.\n\n54:09.020 --> 54:14.380\n And in some sense, a huge fraction\n\n54:14.380 --> 54:16.780\n of all of the technological progress\n\n54:16.780 --> 54:19.260\n that there is in all of civilization\n\n54:19.260 --> 54:22.300\n has gotten concentrated just more narrowly\n\n54:22.300 --> 54:24.860\n into just those problems, right?\n\n54:24.860 --> 54:29.420\n And so it has been one of the biggest success stories\n\n54:29.420 --> 54:31.260\n in the history of technology, right?\n\n54:31.260 --> 54:34.620\n There's, I mean, it is, I am as amazed by it\n\n54:34.620 --> 54:36.620\n as anyone else is, right?\n\n54:36.620 --> 54:40.700\n But at the same time, we also know that it,\n\n54:40.700 --> 54:45.340\n and I really do mean we know\n\n54:45.340 --> 54:48.460\n that it cannot continue indefinitely, okay?\n\n54:48.460 --> 54:52.220\n Because you will reach fundamental limits\n\n54:52.220 --> 54:56.780\n on how small you can possibly make a processor.\n\n54:56.780 --> 54:58.940\n And if you want a real proof\n\n54:58.940 --> 55:01.340\n that would justify my use of the word,\n\n55:01.340 --> 55:04.060\n we know that Moore's law has to end.\n\n55:04.060 --> 55:06.300\n I mean, ultimately you will reach the limits\n\n55:06.300 --> 55:07.820\n imposed by quantum gravity.\n\n55:10.780 --> 55:12.540\n If you tried to build a computer\n\n55:12.540 --> 55:15.580\n that operated at 10 to the 43 Hertz,\n\n55:15.580 --> 55:18.620\n so did 10 to the 43 operations per second,\n\n55:18.620 --> 55:20.780\n that computer would use so much energy\n\n55:20.780 --> 55:24.380\n that it would simply collapse through a black hole, okay?\n\n55:24.380 --> 55:28.620\n So in reality, we're going to reach the limits\n\n55:28.620 --> 55:31.900\n long before that, but that is a sufficient proof.\n\n55:31.900 --> 55:32.700\n That there's a limit.\n\n55:33.420 --> 55:34.220\n Yes, yes.\n\n55:35.820 --> 55:38.220\n But it would be interesting to try to understand\n\n55:38.220 --> 55:40.860\n the mechanism, the economic pressure that you said,\n\n55:40.860 --> 55:44.380\n just like the Cold War was a pressure on getting us,\n\n55:44.380 --> 55:49.340\n getting us, because my us is both the Soviet Union\n\n55:49.340 --> 55:52.380\n and the United States, but getting us,\n\n55:52.380 --> 55:54.780\n the two countries to get to hurry up,\n\n55:54.780 --> 55:56.300\n to get to space, to the moon,\n\n55:56.300 --> 55:58.940\n there seems to be that same kind of economic pressure\n\n55:58.940 --> 56:03.340\n that somehow created a chain of engineering breakthroughs\n\n56:03.340 --> 56:05.580\n that resulted in the Moore's law.\n\n56:05.580 --> 56:07.180\n And it'd be nice to replicate.\n\n56:07.180 --> 56:09.180\n Yeah, well, I mean, some people are sort of,\n\n56:10.380 --> 56:11.980\n get depressed about the fact\n\n56:11.980 --> 56:16.540\n that technological progress may seem to have slowed down\n\n56:16.540 --> 56:19.900\n in many, many realms outside of computing, right?\n\n56:19.900 --> 56:22.620\n And there was this whole thing of we wanted flying cars\n\n56:22.620 --> 56:24.620\n and we only got Twitter instead, right?\n\n56:24.620 --> 56:27.260\n Yeah, good old Peter Thiel, yeah.\n\n56:27.260 --> 56:28.700\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right, right.\n\n56:28.700 --> 56:31.900\n So then jumping to another really interesting topic\n\n56:31.900 --> 56:37.180\n that you mentioned, so Google announced with their work\n\n56:37.180 --> 56:40.460\n in the paper in Nature with quantum supremacy.\n\n56:40.460 --> 56:40.940\n Yes.\n\n56:40.940 --> 56:43.820\n Can you describe, again, back to the basic,\n\n56:43.820 --> 56:47.900\n what is perhaps not so basic, what is quantum supremacy?\n\n56:47.900 --> 56:51.980\n Absolutely, so quantum supremacy is a term\n\n56:51.980 --> 56:56.300\n that was coined by, again, by John Preskill in 2012.\n\n56:57.580 --> 57:02.700\n Not everyone likes the name, but it sort of stuck.\n\n57:04.220 --> 57:07.980\n We don't, we sort of haven't found a better alternative.\n\n57:07.980 --> 57:10.460\n It's technically quantum computational supremacy.\n\n57:10.460 --> 57:12.700\n Yeah, yeah, supremacy, that's right, that's right.\n\n57:12.700 --> 57:16.220\n But the basic idea is actually one that goes all the way back\n\n57:16.220 --> 57:18.460\n to the beginnings of quantum computing\n\n57:18.460 --> 57:21.420\n when Richard Feynman and David Deutsch, people like that,\n\n57:21.420 --> 57:23.260\n were talking about it in the early 80s.\n\n57:24.940 --> 57:28.540\n And quantum supremacy just refers to sort of the point\n\n57:28.540 --> 57:32.380\n in history when you can first use a quantum computer\n\n57:32.380 --> 57:36.380\n to do some well defined task much faster\n\n57:36.380 --> 57:40.460\n than any known algorithm running on any of the classical computers\n\n57:40.460 --> 57:42.220\n that are available, okay?\n\n57:42.220 --> 57:45.820\n So notice that I did not say a useful task, okay?\n\n57:46.540 --> 57:48.940\n It could be something completely artificial,\n\n57:48.940 --> 57:51.740\n but it's important that the task be well defined.\n\n57:51.740 --> 57:55.980\n So in other words, it is something that has right and wrong answers\n\n57:57.100 --> 58:00.460\n that are knowable independently of this device, right?\n\n58:00.460 --> 58:04.300\n And we can then run the device, see if it gets the right answer or not.\n\n58:04.300 --> 58:05.900\n Can you clarify a small point?\n\n58:05.900 --> 58:08.700\n You said much faster than a classical implementation.\n\n58:09.420 --> 58:13.580\n What about sort of what about the space with where the class,\n\n58:13.580 --> 58:16.300\n there's no, there's not, it doesn't even exist,\n\n58:16.300 --> 58:18.780\n a classical algorithm to show the power?\n\n58:18.780 --> 58:20.460\n So maybe I should clarify.\n\n58:20.460 --> 58:22.940\n Everything that a quantum computer can do,\n\n58:22.940 --> 58:26.700\n a classical computer can also eventually do, okay?\n\n58:26.700 --> 58:31.340\n And the reason why we know that is that a classical computer\n\n58:31.340 --> 58:35.500\n could always, you know, if it had no limits of time and memory,\n\n58:35.500 --> 58:39.180\n it could always just store the entire quantum state,\n\n58:39.180 --> 58:41.420\n you know, of your, you know, of the quantum,\n\n58:41.420 --> 58:44.780\n store a list of all the amplitudes,\n\n58:44.780 --> 58:47.260\n you know, in the state of the quantum computer,\n\n58:47.260 --> 58:50.060\n and then just, you know, do some linear algebra\n\n58:50.060 --> 58:52.140\n to just update that state, right?\n\n58:52.140 --> 58:55.420\n And so anything that quantum computers can do\n\n58:55.420 --> 58:58.300\n can also be done by classical computers,\n\n58:58.300 --> 59:00.620\n albeit exponentially slower in some cases.\n\n59:00.620 --> 59:03.740\n So quantum computers don't go into some magical place\n\n59:03.740 --> 59:06.620\n outside of Alan Turing's definition of computation.\n\n59:06.620 --> 59:07.420\n Precisely.\n\n59:07.420 --> 59:09.900\n They do not solve the halting problem.\n\n59:09.900 --> 59:12.620\n They cannot solve anything that is uncomputable\n\n59:12.620 --> 59:14.300\n in Alan Turing's sense.\n\n59:14.300 --> 59:16.620\n What we think they do change\n\n59:16.620 --> 59:19.260\n is what is efficiently computable, okay?\n\n59:19.260 --> 59:22.220\n And, you know, since the 1960s, you know,\n\n59:22.220 --> 59:23.980\n the word efficiently, you know,\n\n59:23.980 --> 59:26.780\n as well has been a central word in computer science,\n\n59:26.780 --> 59:29.900\n but it's sort of a code word for something technical,\n\n59:29.900 --> 59:33.740\n which is basically with polynomial scaling, you know,\n\n59:33.740 --> 59:36.700\n that as you get to larger and larger inputs,\n\n59:36.700 --> 59:39.580\n you would like an algorithm that uses an amount of time\n\n59:39.580 --> 59:42.220\n that scales only like the size of the input\n\n59:42.220 --> 59:43.740\n raised to some power\n\n59:43.740 --> 59:47.180\n and not exponentially with the size of the input, right?\n\n59:47.180 --> 59:49.740\n Yeah, so I do hope we get to talk again\n\n59:49.740 --> 59:52.540\n because one of the many topics\n\n59:52.540 --> 59:55.820\n that there's probably several hours worth of conversation on\n\n59:55.820 --> 59:56.620\n is complexity,\n\n59:56.620 --> 1:00:00.300\n which we probably won't even get a chance to touch today,\n\n1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:02.060\n but you briefly mentioned it,\n\n1:00:02.620 --> 1:00:05.260\n but let's maybe try to continue.\n\n1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:08.540\n So you said the definition of quantum supremacy\n\n1:00:08.540 --> 1:00:12.380\n is basically achieving a place\n\n1:00:12.380 --> 1:00:14.300\n where much faster on a formal,\n\n1:00:14.940 --> 1:00:16.460\n that quantum computer is much faster\n\n1:00:16.460 --> 1:00:18.540\n on a formal well defined problem\n\n1:00:19.340 --> 1:00:21.100\n that is or isn't useful.\n\n1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:22.300\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.\n\n1:00:22.300 --> 1:00:25.260\n And I would say that we really want three things, right?\n\n1:00:25.260 --> 1:00:26.860\n We want, first of all,\n\n1:00:26.860 --> 1:00:29.260\n the quantum computer to be much faster\n\n1:00:29.260 --> 1:00:31.980\n just in the literal sense of like number of seconds,\n\n1:00:31.980 --> 1:00:34.540\n you know, it's a solving this, you know,\n\n1:00:34.540 --> 1:00:36.940\n well defined, you know, problem.\n\n1:00:36.940 --> 1:00:40.540\n Secondly, we want it to be sort of, you know,\n\n1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:42.700\n for a problem where we really believe\n\n1:00:42.700 --> 1:00:45.980\n that a quantum computer has better scaling behavior, right?\n\n1:00:45.980 --> 1:00:48.780\n So it's not just an incidental, you know,\n\n1:00:48.780 --> 1:00:50.060\n matter of hardware,\n\n1:00:50.060 --> 1:00:51.180\n but it's that, you know,\n\n1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:53.900\n as you went to larger and larger inputs,\n\n1:00:53.900 --> 1:00:57.180\n you know, the classical scaling would be exponential\n\n1:00:57.180 --> 1:00:59.660\n and the scaling for the quantum algorithm\n\n1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:01.500\n would only be polynomial.\n\n1:01:01.500 --> 1:01:04.060\n And then thirdly, we want the first thing,\n\n1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:06.220\n the actual observed speed up\n\n1:01:06.220 --> 1:01:10.620\n to only be explainable in terms of the scaling behavior, right?\n\n1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:12.700\n So, you know, I want, you know,\n\n1:01:12.700 --> 1:01:15.740\n a real world, you know, a real problem to get solved,\n\n1:01:16.460 --> 1:01:20.460\n let's say by a quantum computer with 50 qubits or so,\n\n1:01:20.460 --> 1:01:23.580\n and for no one to be able to explain that in any way\n\n1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:30.300\n other than, well, you know, this computer involved a quantum state\n\n1:01:30.300 --> 1:01:33.180\n with two to the 50th power amplitudes.\n\n1:01:33.180 --> 1:01:35.180\n And, you know, a classical simulation,\n\n1:01:35.180 --> 1:01:37.100\n at least any that we know today,\n\n1:01:37.100 --> 1:01:40.460\n would require keeping track of two to the 50th numbers.\n\n1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:42.380\n And this is the reason why it was faster.\n\n1:01:42.380 --> 1:01:46.700\n So the intuition is that then if you demonstrate on 50 qubits,\n\n1:01:46.700 --> 1:01:48.300\n then once you get to 100 qubits,\n\n1:01:48.300 --> 1:01:50.780\n then it'll be even much more faster.\n\n1:01:50.780 --> 1:01:52.460\n Precisely, precisely.\n\n1:01:52.460 --> 1:01:55.020\n Yeah, and, you know, and quantum supremacy\n\n1:01:55.020 --> 1:01:57.100\n does not require error correction, right?\n\n1:01:57.100 --> 1:01:58.860\n We don't, you know, we don't have, you could say,\n\n1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:04.540\n true scalability yet or true, you know, error correction yet.\n\n1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:08.860\n But you could say quantum supremacy is already enough by itself\n\n1:02:08.860 --> 1:02:12.140\n to refute the skeptics who said a quantum computer\n\n1:02:12.140 --> 1:02:15.260\n will never outperform a classical computer for anything.\n\n1:02:15.260 --> 1:02:20.460\n But one, how do you demonstrate quantum supremacy?\n\n1:02:20.460 --> 1:02:23.740\n And two, what's up with these news articles\n\n1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.820\n I'm reading that Google did so?\n\n1:02:25.820 --> 1:02:28.860\n Yeah, all right, well, great, great questions,\n\n1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:31.900\n because now you get into actually, you know,\n\n1:02:31.900 --> 1:02:34.140\n a lot of the work that I've, you know,\n\n1:02:34.140 --> 1:02:36.940\n I and my students have been doing for the last decade,\n\n1:02:36.940 --> 1:02:41.020\n which was precisely about how do you demonstrate\n\n1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:44.220\n quantum supremacy using technologies that, you know,\n\n1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:47.100\n we thought would be available in the near future.\n\n1:02:47.100 --> 1:02:53.740\n And so one of the main things that we realized around 2011,\n\n1:02:53.740 --> 1:02:59.900\n and this was me and my student, Alex Arkhipov at MIT at the time,\n\n1:02:59.900 --> 1:03:03.180\n and independently of some others,\n\n1:03:03.180 --> 1:03:06.220\n including Bremner, Joseph, and Shepherd, okay?\n\n1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:10.940\n And the realization that we came to was that\n\n1:03:10.940 --> 1:03:14.860\n if you just want to prove that a quantum computer is faster,\n\n1:03:14.860 --> 1:03:17.260\n you know, and not do something useful with it,\n\n1:03:17.260 --> 1:03:20.300\n then there are huge advantages to sort of switching\n\n1:03:20.300 --> 1:03:23.900\n your attention from problems like factoring numbers\n\n1:03:23.900 --> 1:03:26.060\n that have a single right answer\n\n1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:28.540\n to what we call sampling problems.\n\n1:03:28.540 --> 1:03:31.980\n So these are problems where the goal is just to output\n\n1:03:31.980 --> 1:03:35.420\n a sample from some probability distribution,\n\n1:03:35.420 --> 1:03:38.060\n let's say over strings of 50 bits, right?\n\n1:03:38.060 --> 1:03:40.060\n So there are, you know, many, many,\n\n1:03:40.060 --> 1:03:42.060\n many possible valid outputs.\n\n1:03:42.060 --> 1:03:44.540\n You know, your computer will probably never even produce\n\n1:03:44.540 --> 1:03:46.540\n the same output twice, you know,\n\n1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:50.620\n if it's running as, even, you know,\n\n1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:52.780\n assuming it's running perfectly, okay?\n\n1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:55.660\n But the key is that some outputs are supposed\n\n1:03:55.660 --> 1:03:57.740\n to be likelier than other ones.\n\n1:03:57.740 --> 1:04:01.980\n So, sorry, to clarify, is there a set of outputs\n\n1:04:01.980 --> 1:04:03.740\n that are valid and set they're not,\n\n1:04:03.740 --> 1:04:06.940\n or is it more that the distribution\n\n1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:11.420\n of a particular kind of output is more,\n\n1:04:11.420 --> 1:04:13.260\n is like there's a specific distribution\n\n1:04:13.260 --> 1:04:14.860\n of a particular kind of output?\n\n1:04:14.860 --> 1:04:16.540\n Yeah, there's a specific distribution\n\n1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:17.980\n that you're trying to hit, right?\n\n1:04:17.980 --> 1:04:19.980\n Or, you know, that you're trying to sample from.\n\n1:04:19.980 --> 1:04:22.460\n Now, there are a lot of questions about this,\n\n1:04:22.460 --> 1:04:24.540\n you know, how do you do that, right?\n\n1:04:24.540 --> 1:04:27.660\n Now, how you do it, you know,\n\n1:04:27.660 --> 1:04:30.220\n it turns out that with a quantum computer,\n\n1:04:30.220 --> 1:04:32.220\n even with the noisy quantum computers\n\n1:04:32.220 --> 1:04:34.780\n that we have now, that we have today,\n\n1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:36.940\n what you can do is basically just apply\n\n1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:40.220\n a randomly chosen sequence of operations, right?\n\n1:04:40.220 --> 1:04:42.380\n So we, you know, in some of the, you know,\n\n1:04:42.380 --> 1:04:44.540\n that part is almost trivial, right?\n\n1:04:44.540 --> 1:04:47.260\n We just sort of get the qubits to interact\n\n1:04:47.260 --> 1:04:48.540\n in some random way,\n\n1:04:48.540 --> 1:04:51.580\n although a sort of precisely specified random way\n\n1:04:51.580 --> 1:04:54.940\n so we can repeat the exact same random sequence\n\n1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:57.580\n of interactions again and get another sample\n\n1:04:57.580 --> 1:04:59.500\n from that same distribution.\n\n1:04:59.500 --> 1:05:01.820\n And what this does is it basically,\n\n1:05:01.820 --> 1:05:04.060\n well, it creates a lot of garbage,\n\n1:05:04.060 --> 1:05:06.620\n but, you know, very specific garbage, right?\n\n1:05:06.620 --> 1:05:09.100\n So, you know, of all of the,\n\n1:05:09.100 --> 1:05:11.340\n so we're gonna talk about Google's device\n\n1:05:11.340 --> 1:05:14.060\n that were 53 qubits there, okay?\n\n1:05:14.060 --> 1:05:18.060\n And so there were two to the 53 power possible outputs.\n\n1:05:18.060 --> 1:05:19.980\n Now, for some of those outputs,\n\n1:05:19.980 --> 1:05:22.540\n you know, there was a little bit more\n\n1:05:22.540 --> 1:05:25.660\n destructive interference in their amplitude, okay?\n\n1:05:25.660 --> 1:05:28.060\n So their amplitudes were a little bit smaller.\n\n1:05:28.060 --> 1:05:29.500\n And for others, there was a little more\n\n1:05:29.500 --> 1:05:31.180\n constructive interference.\n\n1:05:31.180 --> 1:05:32.860\n You know, the amplitudes were a little bit\n\n1:05:32.860 --> 1:05:35.180\n more aligned with each other, you know,\n\n1:05:35.180 --> 1:05:38.860\n and so those were a little bit likelier, okay?\n\n1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:42.140\n All of the outputs are exponentially unlikely,\n\n1:05:42.140 --> 1:05:45.340\n but some are, let's say, two times or three times,\n\n1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:47.740\n you know, unlikelier than others, okay?\n\n1:05:47.740 --> 1:05:50.700\n And so you can define, you know,\n\n1:05:50.700 --> 1:05:53.500\n this sequence of operations that gives rise\n\n1:05:53.500 --> 1:05:55.660\n to this probability distribution.\n\n1:05:55.660 --> 1:05:58.700\n Okay, now the next question would be,\n\n1:05:58.700 --> 1:05:59.660\n well, how do you, you know,\n\n1:05:59.660 --> 1:06:01.020\n even if you're sampling from it,\n\n1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:02.460\n how do you verify that, right?\n\n1:06:02.460 --> 1:06:04.060\n How do you know?\n\n1:06:04.060 --> 1:06:06.780\n And so my students and I,\n\n1:06:06.780 --> 1:06:09.260\n and also the people at Google\n\n1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:10.380\n were doing the experiment,\n\n1:06:10.380 --> 1:06:12.940\n came up with statistical tests\n\n1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:14.940\n that you can apply to the outputs\n\n1:06:15.900 --> 1:06:20.620\n in order to try to verify, you know,\n\n1:06:20.620 --> 1:06:22.620\n what is, you know, that at least\n\n1:06:22.620 --> 1:06:25.100\n that some hard problem is being solved.\n\n1:06:25.900 --> 1:06:27.900\n The test that Google ended up using\n\n1:06:28.620 --> 1:06:29.820\n was something that they called\n\n1:06:29.820 --> 1:06:32.780\n the linear cross entropy benchmark, okay?\n\n1:06:32.780 --> 1:06:34.220\n And it's basically, you know,\n\n1:06:34.220 --> 1:06:36.300\n so the drawback of this test\n\n1:06:36.300 --> 1:06:38.140\n is that it requires, like,\n\n1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:43.020\n it requires you to do a two to the 53 time calculation\n\n1:06:43.020 --> 1:06:44.860\n with your classical computer, okay?\n\n1:06:44.860 --> 1:06:47.740\n So it's very expensive to do the test\n\n1:06:47.740 --> 1:06:49.260\n on a classical computer.\n\n1:06:49.260 --> 1:06:49.900\n The good news is...\n\n1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:51.660\n How big of a number is two to the 53?\n\n1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:53.820\n It's about nine quadrillion, okay?\n\n1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:54.460\n That doesn't help.\n\n1:06:55.100 --> 1:06:55.820\n Well, you know,\n\n1:06:55.820 --> 1:06:58.380\n it's, you want it in like scientific notation.\n\n1:06:58.380 --> 1:06:59.660\n No, no, no, what I mean is...\n\n1:06:59.660 --> 1:07:01.020\n Yeah, it is just...\n\n1:07:01.020 --> 1:07:02.860\n It's impossible to run on a...\n\n1:07:02.860 --> 1:07:04.780\n Yeah, so we will come back to that.\n\n1:07:04.780 --> 1:07:07.420\n It is just barely possible to run,\n\n1:07:07.420 --> 1:07:09.260\n we think, on the largest supercomputer\n\n1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:10.940\n that currently exists on Earth,\n\n1:07:10.940 --> 1:07:14.220\n which is called Summit at Oak Ridge National Lab, okay?\n\n1:07:15.340 --> 1:07:16.780\n Great, this is exciting.\n\n1:07:16.780 --> 1:07:18.220\n That's the short answer.\n\n1:07:18.220 --> 1:07:21.900\n So ironically, for this type of experiment,\n\n1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:24.300\n we don't want 100 qubits, okay?\n\n1:07:24.300 --> 1:07:26.940\n Because with 100 qubits, even if it works,\n\n1:07:26.940 --> 1:07:29.580\n we don't know how to verify the results, okay?\n\n1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:32.060\n So we want, you know, a number of qubits\n\n1:07:32.060 --> 1:07:33.100\n that is enough that, you know,\n\n1:07:33.100 --> 1:07:36.300\n the biggest classical computers on Earth\n\n1:07:36.300 --> 1:07:38.140\n will have to sweat, you know,\n\n1:07:38.140 --> 1:07:39.980\n and we'll just barely, you know,\n\n1:07:39.980 --> 1:07:42.700\n be able to keep up with the quantum computer,\n\n1:07:42.700 --> 1:07:44.460\n you know, using much more time,\n\n1:07:44.460 --> 1:07:46.540\n but they will still be able to do it\n\n1:07:46.540 --> 1:07:48.300\n in order that we can verify the results.\n\n1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:50.540\n Which is where the 53 comes from for the number of qubits?\n\n1:07:50.540 --> 1:07:53.180\n Basically, well, I mean, that's also,\n\n1:07:53.180 --> 1:07:54.300\n that's sort of, you know,\n\n1:07:55.420 --> 1:07:58.780\n I mean, that's sort of where they are now\n\n1:07:58.780 --> 1:08:00.380\n in terms of scaling, you know?\n\n1:08:00.380 --> 1:08:03.100\n And then, you know, soon, you know, that point will be passed.\n\n1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:06.780\n And then when you get to larger numbers of qubits,\n\n1:08:06.780 --> 1:08:10.060\n then, you know, these types of sampling experiments\n\n1:08:10.060 --> 1:08:12.140\n will no longer be so interesting\n\n1:08:12.140 --> 1:08:14.860\n because we won't even be able to verify the results\n\n1:08:14.860 --> 1:08:17.740\n and we'll have to switch to other types of computation.\n\n1:08:17.740 --> 1:08:19.660\n So with the sampling thing,\n\n1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:22.460\n you know, so the test that Google applied\n\n1:08:22.460 --> 1:08:24.700\n with this linear cross entropy benchmark\n\n1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:28.460\n was basically just take the samples that were generated,\n\n1:08:28.460 --> 1:08:30.780\n which are, you know, a very small subset\n\n1:08:30.780 --> 1:08:32.940\n of all the possible samples that there are.\n\n1:08:32.940 --> 1:08:36.540\n But for those, you calculate with your classical computer\n\n1:08:36.540 --> 1:08:38.940\n the probabilities that they should have been output.\n\n1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:41.500\n And you see, are those probabilities\n\n1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:43.020\n like larger than the mean?\n\n1:08:43.020 --> 1:08:45.260\n You know, so is the quantum computer biased\n\n1:08:45.260 --> 1:08:47.500\n toward outputting the strings that it's,\n\n1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:50.300\n you know, that you want it to be biased toward?\n\n1:08:50.300 --> 1:08:51.980\n Okay, and then finally,\n\n1:08:51.980 --> 1:08:54.220\n we come to a very crucial question,\n\n1:08:54.220 --> 1:08:56.140\n which is supposing that it does that.\n\n1:08:56.140 --> 1:08:58.380\n Well, how do we know that a classical computer\n\n1:08:58.380 --> 1:09:01.260\n could not have quickly done the same thing, right?\n\n1:09:01.260 --> 1:09:02.380\n How do we know that, you know,\n\n1:09:02.380 --> 1:09:05.500\n this couldn't have been spoofed by a classical computer, right?\n\n1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:09.820\n And so, well, the first answer is we don't know for sure\n\n1:09:09.820 --> 1:09:11.180\n because, you know, this takes us\n\n1:09:11.180 --> 1:09:13.740\n into questions of complexity theory.\n\n1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:17.740\n You know, I mean, questions of the magnitude\n\n1:09:17.740 --> 1:09:20.380\n of the P versus NP question and things like that, right?\n\n1:09:20.380 --> 1:09:23.500\n You know, we don't know how to rule out definitively\n\n1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:26.540\n that there could be fast classical algorithms\n\n1:09:26.540 --> 1:09:28.940\n for, you know, even simulating quantum mechanics\n\n1:09:28.940 --> 1:09:32.300\n and for, you know, simulating experiments like these,\n\n1:09:32.300 --> 1:09:36.140\n but we can give some evidence against that possibility.\n\n1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:37.980\n And that was sort of the, you know,\n\n1:09:37.980 --> 1:09:40.140\n the main thrust of a lot of the work\n\n1:09:40.140 --> 1:09:42.540\n that my colleagues and I did, you know,\n\n1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:43.660\n over the last decade,\n\n1:09:43.660 --> 1:09:46.780\n which is then sort of in around 2015 or so,\n\n1:09:46.780 --> 1:09:49.900\n what led to Google deciding to do this experiment.\n\n1:09:49.900 --> 1:09:52.540\n So is the kind of evidence here,\n\n1:09:52.540 --> 1:09:55.820\n first of all, the hard P equals NP problem that you mentioned\n\n1:09:55.820 --> 1:10:00.780\n and the kind of evidence that you were looking at,\n\n1:10:00.780 --> 1:10:03.740\n is that something you come to on a sheet of paper\n\n1:10:03.740 --> 1:10:07.420\n or is this something, are these empirical experiments?\n\n1:10:07.420 --> 1:10:09.500\n It's math for the most part.\n\n1:10:09.500 --> 1:10:12.700\n I mean, you know, it's also, you know,\n\n1:10:12.700 --> 1:10:15.740\n we have a bunch of methods\n\n1:10:15.740 --> 1:10:19.980\n that are known for simulating quantum circuits\n\n1:10:19.980 --> 1:10:23.500\n or quantum computations with classical computers.\n\n1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.260\n And so we have to try them all out\n\n1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:27.500\n and make sure that, you know, they don't work,\n\n1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:30.220\n you know, make sure that they have exponential scaling\n\n1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:34.140\n on, you know, these problems and not just theoretically,\n\n1:10:34.140 --> 1:10:36.300\n but with the actual range of parameters\n\n1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:40.300\n that are actually, you know, arising in Google's experiment.\n\n1:10:40.300 --> 1:10:43.340\n Okay, so there is an empirical component to it, right?\n\n1:10:43.340 --> 1:10:47.100\n But now on the theoretical side,\n\n1:10:47.100 --> 1:10:49.740\n you know, basically what we know how to do\n\n1:10:49.740 --> 1:10:53.580\n in theoretical computer science and computational complexity\n\n1:10:53.580 --> 1:10:56.060\n is, you know, we don't know how to prove\n\n1:10:56.060 --> 1:10:58.780\n that most of the problems we care about are hard,\n\n1:10:58.780 --> 1:11:01.900\n but we know how to pass the blame to someone else, okay?\n\n1:11:01.900 --> 1:11:03.980\n We know how to say, well, look, you know,\n\n1:11:03.980 --> 1:11:06.300\n I can't prove that this problem is hard,\n\n1:11:06.300 --> 1:11:08.860\n but if it is easy, then all these other things\n\n1:11:08.860 --> 1:11:13.020\n that, you know, you probably were much more confident\n\n1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:16.780\n or were hard, then those would be easy as well, okay?\n\n1:11:16.780 --> 1:11:19.660\n So we can give what are called reductions.\n\n1:11:19.660 --> 1:11:22.700\n This has been the basic strategy in, you know,\n\n1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:27.420\n NP completeness, right, in all of theoretical computer science\n\n1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:31.020\n and cryptography since the 1970s, really.\n\n1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:34.300\n And so we were able to give some reduction evidence\n\n1:11:34.300 --> 1:11:40.140\n for the hardness of simulating these sampling experiments,\n\n1:11:40.140 --> 1:11:43.100\n these sampling based quantum supremacy experiments.\n\n1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:47.260\n So reduction evidence is not as satisfactory as it should be.\n\n1:11:47.260 --> 1:11:49.900\n One of the biggest open problems in this area\n\n1:11:49.900 --> 1:11:51.420\n is to make it better.\n\n1:11:51.420 --> 1:11:53.260\n But, you know, we can do something.\n\n1:11:53.260 --> 1:11:56.700\n You know, certainly we can say that, you know,\n\n1:11:56.700 --> 1:11:59.340\n if there is a fast classical algorithm\n\n1:11:59.340 --> 1:12:02.220\n to spoof these experiments, then it has to be very,\n\n1:12:02.220 --> 1:12:04.620\n very unlike any of the algorithms that we know.\n\n1:12:04.620 --> 1:12:08.940\n TREVOR Which is kind of in the same kind\n\n1:12:08.940 --> 1:12:12.700\n of space of reasoning that people say P not equals NP.\n\n1:12:12.700 --> 1:12:17.500\n BENJAMIN Yeah, it's in the same spirit.\n\n1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:22.220\n TREVOR Okay, so Andrew Yang, a very intelligent\n\n1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:27.420\n and a presidential candidate with a lot of interesting ideas\n\n1:12:27.420 --> 1:12:31.980\n in all kinds of technological fields, tweeted that\n\n1:12:31.980 --> 1:12:35.180\n because of quantum computing, no code is uncrackable.\n\n1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:37.980\n Is he wrong or right?\n\n1:12:37.980 --> 1:12:40.860\n BENJAMIN He was premature, let's say.\n\n1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:42.540\n So, well, okay, wrong.\n\n1:12:45.020 --> 1:12:49.500\n Look, I'm actually, you know, I'm a fan of Andrew Yang.\n\n1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:51.580\n I like his ideas.\n\n1:12:51.580 --> 1:12:52.780\n I like his candidacy.\n\n1:12:53.820 --> 1:12:58.140\n I think that, you know, he may be ahead of his time\n\n1:12:58.140 --> 1:13:01.660\n with, you know, the universal basic income and so forth.\n\n1:13:01.660 --> 1:13:04.700\n And he may also be ahead of his time in that tweet\n\n1:13:04.700 --> 1:13:05.980\n that you referenced.\n\n1:13:05.980 --> 1:13:09.420\n So regarding using quantum computers\n\n1:13:09.420 --> 1:13:13.260\n to break cryptography, so the situation is this, okay?\n\n1:13:13.260 --> 1:13:18.940\n So the famous discovery of Peter Shor, you know, 26 years ago\n\n1:13:18.940 --> 1:13:21.340\n that really started quantum computing, you know,\n\n1:13:21.340 --> 1:13:26.140\n as an autonomous field was that if you built a full\n\n1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:29.660\n scalable quantum computer, then you could use it\n\n1:13:29.660 --> 1:13:35.180\n to efficiently find the prime factors of huge numbers\n\n1:13:35.180 --> 1:13:38.860\n and calculate discrete logarithms and solve\n\n1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:41.820\n a few other problems that are very, very special\n\n1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:42.860\n in character, right?\n\n1:13:42.860 --> 1:13:44.780\n They're not NP complete problems.\n\n1:13:44.780 --> 1:13:46.460\n We're pretty sure they're not, okay?\n\n1:13:46.460 --> 1:13:52.060\n But it so happens that most of the public key cryptography\n\n1:13:52.060 --> 1:13:54.380\n that we currently use to protect the internet\n\n1:13:54.380 --> 1:13:57.660\n is based on the belief that these problems are hard.\n\n1:13:57.660 --> 1:13:59.900\n Okay, what Shor showed is that once you get\n\n1:13:59.900 --> 1:14:03.260\n scalable quantum computers, then that's no longer true, okay?\n\n1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:06.860\n But now, you know, before people panic,\n\n1:14:06.860 --> 1:14:09.740\n there are two important points to understand here.\n\n1:14:09.740 --> 1:14:13.180\n Okay, the first is that quantum supremacy,\n\n1:14:13.180 --> 1:14:15.740\n the milestone that Google just achieved,\n\n1:14:15.740 --> 1:14:19.660\n is very, very far from the kind of scalable quantum computer\n\n1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:21.900\n that would be needed to actually threaten\n\n1:14:21.900 --> 1:14:23.500\n public key cryptography.\n\n1:14:23.500 --> 1:14:25.740\n Okay, so, you know, we touched on this earlier, right?\n\n1:14:25.740 --> 1:14:29.740\n But Google's device has 53 physical qubits, right?\n\n1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:33.020\n To threaten cryptography, you're talking, you know,\n\n1:14:33.020 --> 1:14:35.020\n with any of the known error correction methods,\n\n1:14:35.020 --> 1:14:37.420\n you're talking millions of physical qubits.\n\n1:14:37.420 --> 1:14:39.660\n Because error correction would be required\n\n1:14:39.660 --> 1:14:40.860\n to threaten cryptography.\n\n1:14:40.860 --> 1:14:46.860\n Yes, yes, yes, it certainly would, right?\n\n1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:51.020\n And, you know, how much, you know,\n\n1:14:51.020 --> 1:14:53.820\n how great will the overhead be from the error correction?\n\n1:14:53.820 --> 1:14:55.180\n That we don't know yet.\n\n1:14:55.180 --> 1:14:58.860\n But with the known codes, you're talking millions\n\n1:14:58.860 --> 1:15:01.580\n of physical qubits and of a much higher quality\n\n1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:03.260\n than any that we have now, okay?\n\n1:15:03.260 --> 1:15:07.900\n So, you know, I don't think that that is, you know,\n\n1:15:07.900 --> 1:15:12.060\n coming soon, although people who have secrets\n\n1:15:12.060 --> 1:15:15.420\n that, you know, need to stay secret for 20 years,\n\n1:15:15.420 --> 1:15:17.740\n you know, are already worried about this,\n\n1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:19.900\n you know, for the good reason that, you know,\n\n1:15:19.900 --> 1:15:22.620\n we presume that intelligence agencies\n\n1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:25.260\n are already scooping up data, you know,\n\n1:15:25.260 --> 1:15:27.980\n in the hope that eventually they'll be able to decode it\n\n1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:30.780\n once quantum computers become available, okay?\n\n1:15:30.780 --> 1:15:35.580\n So this brings me to the second point I wanted to make,\n\n1:15:35.580 --> 1:15:39.420\n which is that there are other public key cryptosystems\n\n1:15:39.420 --> 1:15:43.260\n that are known that we don't know how to break\n\n1:15:43.260 --> 1:15:45.420\n even with quantum computers, okay?\n\n1:15:45.420 --> 1:15:48.460\n And so there's a whole field devoted to this now,\n\n1:15:48.460 --> 1:15:51.660\n which is called post quantum cryptography, okay?\n\n1:15:51.660 --> 1:15:55.580\n And so there is already, so we have some good candidates now.\n\n1:15:56.300 --> 1:15:58.460\n The best known being what are called\n\n1:15:58.460 --> 1:16:00.620\n lattice based cryptosystems.\n\n1:16:00.620 --> 1:16:03.500\n And there is already some push to try to migrate\n\n1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:04.780\n to these cryptosystems.\n\n1:16:04.780 --> 1:16:09.900\n So NIST in the US is holding a competition\n\n1:16:09.900 --> 1:16:13.420\n to create standards for post quantum cryptography,\n\n1:16:13.980 --> 1:16:16.460\n which will be the first step in trying to get\n\n1:16:16.460 --> 1:16:20.380\n every web browser and every router to upgrade,\n\n1:16:20.380 --> 1:16:23.660\n you know, and use, you know, something like SSL\n\n1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:26.220\n that would be based on, you know,\n\n1:16:26.220 --> 1:16:29.340\n what we think is quantum secure cryptography.\n\n1:16:29.340 --> 1:16:31.660\n But, you know, this will be a long process.\n\n1:16:33.340 --> 1:16:35.180\n But, you know, it is something that people\n\n1:16:35.180 --> 1:16:36.780\n are already starting to do.\n\n1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:40.300\n And so, you know, I'm sure this algorithm\n\n1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:42.780\n is sort of a dramatic discovery.\n\n1:16:42.780 --> 1:16:44.220\n You know, it could be a big deal\n\n1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:46.220\n for whatever intelligence agency\n\n1:16:46.220 --> 1:16:48.780\n first gets a scalable quantum computer,\n\n1:16:48.780 --> 1:16:51.260\n if no, at least certainly if no one else\n\n1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:52.860\n knows that they have it, right?\n\n1:16:53.580 --> 1:16:57.740\n But eventually we think that we could migrate\n\n1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:00.380\n the internet to the post quantum cryptography\n\n1:17:00.380 --> 1:17:03.340\n and then we'd be more or less back where we started.\n\n1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:06.060\n Okay, so this is sort of not the application\n\n1:17:06.060 --> 1:17:07.180\n of quantum computing.\n\n1:17:07.180 --> 1:17:09.340\n I think that's really gonna change the world\n\n1:17:09.340 --> 1:17:10.860\n in a sustainable way, right?\n\n1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:14.140\n The big, by the way, the biggest practical application\n\n1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:17.340\n of quantum computing that we know about by far,\n\n1:17:17.340 --> 1:17:19.420\n I think is simply the simulation\n\n1:17:19.420 --> 1:17:21.340\n of quantum mechanics itself.\n\n1:17:21.340 --> 1:17:24.780\n In order to, you know, learn about chemical reactions,\n\n1:17:24.780 --> 1:17:28.380\n you know, design maybe new chemical processes,\n\n1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:32.700\n new materials, new drugs, new solar cells,\n\n1:17:32.700 --> 1:17:35.660\n new superconductors, all kinds of things like that.\n\n1:17:35.660 --> 1:17:37.660\n What's the size of a quantum computer\n\n1:17:38.700 --> 1:17:41.820\n that would be able to simulate the,\n\n1:17:41.820 --> 1:17:43.900\n you know, quantum mechanical systems themselves\n\n1:17:44.700 --> 1:17:46.780\n that would be impactful for the real world\n\n1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:49.500\n for the kind of chemical reactions\n\n1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:50.540\n and that kind of work?\n\n1:17:50.540 --> 1:17:51.900\n What scale are we talking about?\n\n1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:55.820\n Now you're asking a very, very current question,\n\n1:17:55.820 --> 1:17:56.940\n a very big question.\n\n1:17:57.740 --> 1:18:00.940\n People are going to be racing over the next decade\n\n1:18:00.940 --> 1:18:04.140\n to try to do useful quantum simulations\n\n1:18:04.780 --> 1:18:09.100\n even with, you know, 100 or 200 qubit quantum computers\n\n1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:11.500\n of the sort that we expect to be able to build\n\n1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:12.860\n over the next decade.\n\n1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:15.580\n Okay, so that might be, you know,\n\n1:18:15.580 --> 1:18:18.460\n the first application of quantum computing\n\n1:18:18.460 --> 1:18:20.380\n that we're able to realize, you know,\n\n1:18:20.380 --> 1:18:23.100\n or maybe it will prove to be too difficult\n\n1:18:23.100 --> 1:18:26.060\n and maybe even that will require fault tolerance\n\n1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:28.300\n or, you know, will require error correction.\n\n1:18:28.300 --> 1:18:30.460\n So there's an aggressive race to come up\n\n1:18:30.460 --> 1:18:33.900\n with the one case study kind of like Peter Schor\n\n1:18:35.500 --> 1:18:37.260\n with the idea that would just capture\n\n1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:38.860\n the world's imagination of like,\n\n1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:41.820\n look, we can actually do something very useful here.\n\n1:18:41.820 --> 1:18:44.140\n Right, but I think, you know, within the next decade,\n\n1:18:44.140 --> 1:18:46.700\n the best shot we have is certainly not,\n\n1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:50.860\n you know, using Schor's algorithm to break cryptography,\n\n1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:53.020\n you know, just because it requires,\n\n1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:55.740\n you know, too much in the way of error correction.\n\n1:18:55.740 --> 1:18:59.820\n The best shot we have is to do some quantum simulation\n\n1:18:59.820 --> 1:19:02.300\n that tells the material scientists\n\n1:19:02.300 --> 1:19:05.500\n or chemists or nuclear physicists,\n\n1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:07.340\n you know, something that is useful to them\n\n1:19:07.340 --> 1:19:08.940\n and that they didn't already know,\n\n1:19:08.940 --> 1:19:11.580\n you know, and you might only need one or two successes\n\n1:19:11.580 --> 1:19:12.940\n in order to change some, you know,\n\n1:19:12.940 --> 1:19:14.620\n billion dollar industries, right?\n\n1:19:14.620 --> 1:19:18.300\n Like, you know, the way that people make fertilizer right now\n\n1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:20.700\n is still based on the Haber Bosch process\n\n1:19:20.700 --> 1:19:22.140\n from a century ago.\n\n1:19:22.140 --> 1:19:25.420\n And it is some many body quantum mechanics problem\n\n1:19:25.420 --> 1:19:27.260\n that no one really understands, right?\n\n1:19:27.260 --> 1:19:30.700\n If you could design a better way to make fertilizer, right?\n\n1:19:30.700 --> 1:19:33.180\n That's, you know, billions of dollars right there.\n\n1:19:33.180 --> 1:19:35.980\n So those are sort of the applications\n\n1:19:35.980 --> 1:19:38.620\n that people are going to be aggressively racing toward\n\n1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:40.060\n over the next decade.\n\n1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:42.460\n Now, I don't know if they're gonna realize it or not,\n\n1:19:42.460 --> 1:19:46.140\n but, you know, they certainly at least have a shot.\n\n1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:48.780\n So it's gonna be a very, very interesting next decade.\n\n1:19:48.780 --> 1:19:50.940\n But just to clarify, what's your intuition?\n\n1:19:51.980 --> 1:19:53.980\n If a breakthrough like that comes with,\n\n1:19:53.980 --> 1:19:56.620\n is it possible for that breakthrough to be on 50\n\n1:19:56.620 --> 1:20:01.020\n to 100 qubits or is scale a fundamental thing\n\n1:20:01.020 --> 1:20:04.220\n like 500, 1000 plus qubits?\n\n1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:08.460\n Yeah, so I can tell you what the current studies are saying.\n\n1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:12.060\n You know, I think probably better to rely on that\n\n1:20:12.060 --> 1:20:13.260\n than on my intuition.\n\n1:20:13.900 --> 1:20:17.500\n But, you know, there was a group at Microsoft\n\n1:20:17.500 --> 1:20:20.780\n had a study a few years ago that said\n\n1:20:20.780 --> 1:20:23.660\n even with only about 100 qubits,\n\n1:20:23.660 --> 1:20:26.060\n you know, you could already learn something new\n\n1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:30.780\n about the chemical reaction that makes fertilizer, for example.\n\n1:20:30.780 --> 1:20:34.460\n The trouble is they're talking about 100 qubits\n\n1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:38.780\n and about a million layers of quantum gates.\n\n1:20:38.780 --> 1:20:40.700\n Okay, so basically they're talking about\n\n1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:42.940\n 100 nearly perfect qubits.\n\n1:20:42.940 --> 1:20:44.700\n So the logical qubits, as you mentioned before.\n\n1:20:44.700 --> 1:20:47.500\n Yeah, exactly, 100 logical qubits.\n\n1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:50.700\n And now, you know, the hard part for the next decade\n\n1:20:50.700 --> 1:20:52.220\n is gonna be, well, what can we do\n\n1:20:52.220 --> 1:20:55.020\n with 100 to 200 noisy qubits?\n\n1:20:56.220 --> 1:20:59.020\n Yeah, is there error correction breakthroughs\n\n1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:00.860\n that might come without the need to do\n\n1:21:01.900 --> 1:21:04.940\n thousands or millions of physical qubits?\n\n1:21:04.940 --> 1:21:07.820\n Yeah, so people are gonna be pushing simultaneously\n\n1:21:07.820 --> 1:21:09.820\n on a bunch of different directions.\n\n1:21:09.820 --> 1:21:11.020\n One direction, of course,\n\n1:21:11.020 --> 1:21:13.180\n is just making the qubits better, right?\n\n1:21:14.140 --> 1:21:16.940\n And, you know, there is tremendous progress there.\n\n1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:19.260\n I mean, you know, the fidelity is like\n\n1:21:19.260 --> 1:21:22.540\n the accuracy of the qubits has improved\n\n1:21:22.540 --> 1:21:24.540\n by several orders of magnitude, you know,\n\n1:21:24.540 --> 1:21:28.220\n in the last decade or two.\n\n1:21:28.220 --> 1:21:31.660\n Okay, the second thing is designing better error,\n\n1:21:31.660 --> 1:21:36.060\n you know, let's say lower overhead error correcting codes\n\n1:21:36.060 --> 1:21:40.140\n and even short of doing the full recursive error correction.\n\n1:21:40.140 --> 1:21:43.340\n You know, there are these error mitigation strategies\n\n1:21:43.340 --> 1:21:45.660\n that you can use, you know, that may, you know,\n\n1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:52.300\n allow you to eke out a useful speed up in the near term.\n\n1:21:52.300 --> 1:21:56.140\n And then the third thing is just taking the quantum algorithms\n\n1:21:56.140 --> 1:21:59.900\n for simulating quantum chemistry or materials\n\n1:21:59.900 --> 1:22:01.740\n and making them more efficient.\n\n1:22:01.740 --> 1:22:03.180\n You know, and those algorithms\n\n1:22:03.180 --> 1:22:05.580\n are already dramatically more efficient\n\n1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:07.900\n than they were, let's say, five years ago.\n\n1:22:07.900 --> 1:22:10.460\n And so when, you know, I quoted these estimates\n\n1:22:10.460 --> 1:22:13.260\n like, you know, circuit depth of one million.\n\n1:22:13.260 --> 1:22:16.700\n And so, you know, I hope that because people will care enough\n\n1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:18.140\n that these numbers are gonna come down.\n\n1:22:18.860 --> 1:22:24.380\n So you're one of the world class researchers in this space.\n\n1:22:24.380 --> 1:22:26.060\n There's a few groups like you mentioned,\n\n1:22:26.060 --> 1:22:27.820\n Google and IBM working at this.\n\n1:22:27.820 --> 1:22:32.140\n There's other research labs, but you put also,\n\n1:22:32.140 --> 1:22:35.820\n you have an amazing blog.\n\n1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:39.980\n You just, you put a lot, you paid me to say it.\n\n1:22:41.180 --> 1:22:44.060\n You put a lot of effort sort of to communicating\n\n1:22:44.060 --> 1:22:47.900\n the science of this and communicating,\n\n1:22:47.900 --> 1:22:52.060\n exposing some of the BS and sort of the natural,\n\n1:22:52.060 --> 1:22:56.700\n just like in the AI space, the natural charlatanism,\n\n1:22:56.700 --> 1:23:00.940\n if that's a word in this, in the quantum mechanics in general,\n\n1:23:00.940 --> 1:23:02.860\n but quantum computers and so on.\n\n1:23:02.860 --> 1:23:07.260\n Can you give some notes about people or ideas\n\n1:23:07.900 --> 1:23:10.220\n that people like me or listeners in general\n\n1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:12.540\n from outside the field should be cautious of\n\n1:23:12.540 --> 1:23:15.820\n when they're taking in news headings\n\n1:23:15.820 --> 1:23:18.700\n that Google achieved quantum supremacy?\n\n1:23:19.340 --> 1:23:21.420\n So what should we look out for?\n\n1:23:21.420 --> 1:23:23.020\n Where's the charlatans in the space?\n\n1:23:23.020 --> 1:23:23.980\n Where's the BS?\n\n1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:26.620\n Yeah, so good question.\n\n1:23:26.620 --> 1:23:29.900\n Unfortunately, quantum computing is a little bit like\n\n1:23:29.900 --> 1:23:32.700\n cryptocurrency or deep learning.\n\n1:23:32.700 --> 1:23:34.220\n Like there is a core of something\n\n1:23:34.220 --> 1:23:37.260\n that is genuinely revolutionary and exciting.\n\n1:23:37.260 --> 1:23:40.460\n And because of that core, it attracts this sort of\n\n1:23:40.460 --> 1:23:47.260\n vast penumbra of people making just utterly ridiculous claims.\n\n1:23:47.260 --> 1:23:50.860\n And so with quantum computing, I mean,\n\n1:23:50.860 --> 1:23:54.860\n I would say that the main way that people go astray\n\n1:23:54.860 --> 1:23:59.100\n is by not focusing on sort of the question of,\n\n1:23:59.100 --> 1:24:02.860\n are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not?\n\n1:24:03.500 --> 1:24:08.860\n And so people have like dismissed quantum supremacy\n\n1:24:08.860 --> 1:24:10.620\n because it's not useful, right?\n\n1:24:10.620 --> 1:24:14.860\n Or it's not itself, let's say, obviously useful for anything.\n\n1:24:14.860 --> 1:24:18.300\n Okay, but ironically, these are some of the same people\n\n1:24:18.300 --> 1:24:21.900\n who will go and say, well, we care about useful applications.\n\n1:24:21.900 --> 1:24:25.020\n We care about solving traffic routing\n\n1:24:25.020 --> 1:24:28.620\n and financial optimization and all these things.\n\n1:24:28.620 --> 1:24:33.500\n And that sounds really good, but their entire spiel\n\n1:24:33.500 --> 1:24:37.260\n is sort of counting on nobody asking the question,\n\n1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:39.900\n yes, but how well could a classical computer\n\n1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:41.740\n do the same thing, right?\n\n1:24:42.700 --> 1:24:47.500\n I really mean the entire thing is they say,\n\n1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:49.180\n well, a quantum computer can do this,\n\n1:24:49.180 --> 1:24:50.700\n a quantum computer can do that.\n\n1:24:50.700 --> 1:24:52.380\n A quantum computer can do that, right?\n\n1:24:52.380 --> 1:24:55.180\n And they just avoid the question,\n\n1:24:55.180 --> 1:24:58.780\n are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not?\n\n1:24:58.780 --> 1:25:01.340\n And if so, how do you know?\n\n1:25:01.340 --> 1:25:05.420\n Have you really thought carefully about classical algorithms\n\n1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:07.820\n to solve the same problem, right?\n\n1:25:07.820 --> 1:25:10.220\n And a lot of the application areas\n\n1:25:10.220 --> 1:25:15.220\n that the companies and investors are most excited about\n\n1:25:16.700 --> 1:25:19.900\n that the popular press is most excited about\n\n1:25:19.900 --> 1:25:21.740\n where quantum computers have been things\n\n1:25:21.740 --> 1:25:26.740\n like machine learning, AI, optimization, okay?\n\n1:25:27.380 --> 1:25:31.820\n And the problem with that is that since the very beginning,\n\n1:25:31.820 --> 1:25:35.980\n even if you have a perfect fault tolerant,\n\n1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:38.540\n scalable quantum computer,\n\n1:25:40.300 --> 1:25:43.100\n we have known of only modest speed ups\n\n1:25:43.100 --> 1:25:46.420\n that you can get for these problems, okay?\n\n1:25:46.420 --> 1:25:48.780\n So there is a famous quantum algorithm\n\n1:25:48.780 --> 1:25:50.860\n called Grover's algorithm, okay?\n\n1:25:50.860 --> 1:25:52.980\n And what it can do is it can solve many,\n\n1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:56.060\n many of the problems that arise in AI,\n\n1:25:56.060 --> 1:25:58.180\n machine learning, optimization,\n\n1:25:58.180 --> 1:26:00.780\n including NP complete problems, okay?\n\n1:26:00.780 --> 1:26:03.540\n But it can solve them in about the square root\n\n1:26:03.540 --> 1:26:06.700\n of the number of steps that a classical computer would need\n\n1:26:06.700 --> 1:26:08.260\n for the same problems, okay?\n\n1:26:08.260 --> 1:26:12.340\n Now a square root speed up is important, it's impressive.\n\n1:26:12.340 --> 1:26:15.140\n It is not an exponential speed up, okay?\n\n1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.780\n So it is not the kind of game changer\n\n1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:20.820\n that let's say Shor's algorithm for factoring is,\n\n1:26:20.820 --> 1:26:23.700\n or for that matter that simulation of quantum mechanics is,\n\n1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:26.260\n okay, it is a more modest speed up.\n\n1:26:26.260 --> 1:26:28.780\n And let's say roughly, in theory,\n\n1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:30.380\n it could roughly double the size\n\n1:26:30.380 --> 1:26:33.380\n of the optimization problems that you could handle, right?\n\n1:26:33.380 --> 1:26:38.380\n And so because people found that I guess too boring\n\n1:26:39.300 --> 1:26:43.980\n or too unimpressive, they've gone on to like invent\n\n1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:46.340\n all of these heuristic algorithms\n\n1:26:46.340 --> 1:26:49.380\n where because no one really understands them,\n\n1:26:49.380 --> 1:26:52.500\n you can just project your hopes onto them, right?\n\n1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:55.780\n That, well, maybe it gets an exponential speed up.\n\n1:26:55.780 --> 1:26:57.740\n You can't prove that it doesn't,\n\n1:26:57.740 --> 1:26:59.300\n and the burden is on you to prove\n\n1:26:59.300 --> 1:27:00.820\n that it doesn't get a speed up, right?\n\n1:27:00.820 --> 1:27:04.860\n And so they've done an immense amount of that kind of thing.\n\n1:27:04.860 --> 1:27:08.020\n And a really worrying amount of the case\n\n1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:10.740\n for building a quantum computer has come to rest\n\n1:27:10.740 --> 1:27:13.620\n on this stuff that those of us in this field\n\n1:27:13.620 --> 1:27:17.620\n know perfectly well is on extremely shaky foundations.\n\n1:27:17.620 --> 1:27:20.620\n So the fundamental question is,\n\n1:27:20.620 --> 1:27:23.500\n show that there's a speed up over the classical.\n\n1:27:23.500 --> 1:27:24.340\n Absolutely.\n\n1:27:24.340 --> 1:27:26.500\n And in this space that you're referring to,\n\n1:27:26.500 --> 1:27:27.660\n which is actually really interesting,\n\n1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:30.100\n it's the area that a lot of people excited about\n\n1:27:30.100 --> 1:27:31.340\n is machine learning.\n\n1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:34.700\n So your sense is, do you think it will,\n\n1:27:34.700 --> 1:27:37.740\n I know that there's a lot of smoke currently,\n\n1:27:37.740 --> 1:27:40.300\n but do you think there actually eventually\n\n1:27:40.300 --> 1:27:45.020\n might be breakthroughs where you do get exponential speed ups\n\n1:27:45.020 --> 1:27:46.580\n in the machine learning space?\n\n1:27:46.580 --> 1:27:48.020\n Absolutely, there might be.\n\n1:27:48.020 --> 1:27:50.700\n I mean, I think we know of modest speed ups\n\n1:27:50.700 --> 1:27:52.700\n that you can get for these problems.\n\n1:27:52.700 --> 1:27:55.540\n I think, you know, whether you can get bigger speed ups\n\n1:27:55.540 --> 1:28:00.380\n is one of the biggest questions for quantum computing theory,\n\n1:28:00.380 --> 1:28:03.620\n you know, for people like me to be thinking about.\n\n1:28:03.620 --> 1:28:06.740\n Now, you know, we had actually recently\n\n1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:11.020\n a really, you know, a super exciting candidate\n\n1:28:11.020 --> 1:28:13.620\n for an exponential quantum speed up\n\n1:28:13.620 --> 1:28:15.220\n for a machine learning problem\n\n1:28:15.220 --> 1:28:16.820\n that people really care about.\n\n1:28:16.820 --> 1:28:19.140\n This is basically the Netflix problem,\n\n1:28:19.140 --> 1:28:22.420\n the problem of recommending products to users\n\n1:28:22.420 --> 1:28:25.580\n given some sparse data about their preferences.\n\n1:28:25.580 --> 1:28:29.540\n Karinidis and Prakash in 2016 had an algorithm\n\n1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:33.700\n for sampling recommendations that was exponentially faster\n\n1:28:33.700 --> 1:28:35.980\n than any known classical algorithm, right?\n\n1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:37.980\n And so, you know, a lot of people were excited.\n\n1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:40.100\n I was excited about it.\n\n1:28:40.100 --> 1:28:44.500\n I had an 18 year old undergrad by the name of Yilin Tang,\n\n1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:47.140\n and she was obviously brilliant.\n\n1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:48.780\n She was looking for a project.\n\n1:28:48.780 --> 1:28:50.340\n I gave her as a project,\n\n1:28:50.340 --> 1:28:52.860\n can you prove that this speed up is real?\n\n1:28:52.860 --> 1:28:55.580\n Can you prove that, you know, any classical algorithm\n\n1:28:55.580 --> 1:28:58.820\n would need to access exponentially more data, right?\n\n1:28:58.820 --> 1:29:01.660\n And, you know, this was a case where if that was true,\n\n1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:04.660\n this was not like a P versus NP type of question, right?\n\n1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:07.060\n This might well have been provable,\n\n1:29:07.060 --> 1:29:09.100\n but she worked on it for a year.\n\n1:29:09.100 --> 1:29:10.540\n She couldn't do it.\n\n1:29:10.540 --> 1:29:13.340\n Eventually she figured out why she couldn't do it.\n\n1:29:13.340 --> 1:29:15.420\n And the reason was that that was false.\n\n1:29:15.420 --> 1:29:18.140\n There is a classical algorithm\n\n1:29:18.140 --> 1:29:20.820\n with a similar performance to the quantum algorithm.\n\n1:29:20.820 --> 1:29:23.860\n So Yilin succeeded in dequantizing\n\n1:29:23.860 --> 1:29:25.300\n that machine learning algorithm.\n\n1:29:25.300 --> 1:29:27.940\n And then in the last couple of years,\n\n1:29:27.940 --> 1:29:30.180\n building on Yilin's breakthrough,\n\n1:29:30.180 --> 1:29:32.980\n a bunch of the other quantum machine learning algorithms\n\n1:29:32.980 --> 1:29:36.180\n that were proposed have now also been dequantized.\n\n1:29:36.180 --> 1:29:37.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:37.020 --> 1:29:37.860\n Okay, and so I would say, yeah.\n\n1:29:37.860 --> 1:29:40.100\n That's a kind of important backwards step.\n\n1:29:40.100 --> 1:29:41.260\n Yes.\n\n1:29:41.260 --> 1:29:43.580\n Like a forward step for science,\n\n1:29:43.580 --> 1:29:46.940\n but a step for quantum machine learning\n\n1:29:46.940 --> 1:29:50.780\n that precedes the big next forward step.\n\n1:29:50.780 --> 1:29:51.740\n Right, right, right.\n\n1:29:51.740 --> 1:29:52.580\n If it's possible.\n\n1:29:52.580 --> 1:29:54.300\n Right, now some people will say,\n\n1:29:54.300 --> 1:29:57.020\n well, you know, there's a silver lining in this cloud.\n\n1:29:57.020 --> 1:29:59.260\n They say, well, thinking about quantum computing\n\n1:29:59.260 --> 1:30:01.020\n has led to the discovery\n\n1:30:01.020 --> 1:30:03.860\n of potentially useful new classical algorithms.\n\n1:30:03.860 --> 1:30:04.700\n That's true.\n\n1:30:04.700 --> 1:30:07.460\n And so, you know, so you get these spinoff applications,\n\n1:30:07.460 --> 1:30:09.300\n but if you want a quantum speed up,\n\n1:30:09.300 --> 1:30:11.860\n you really have to think carefully about that.\n\n1:30:11.860 --> 1:30:15.220\n You know, Yilin's work was a perfect illustration of why.\n\n1:30:15.220 --> 1:30:18.820\n Right, and I think that, you know, the challenge,\n\n1:30:18.820 --> 1:30:22.340\n you know, the field is now open, right?\n\n1:30:22.340 --> 1:30:23.820\n Find a better example,\n\n1:30:23.820 --> 1:30:26.580\n find, you know, where quantum computers\n\n1:30:26.580 --> 1:30:29.420\n are going to deliver big gains for machine learning.\n\n1:30:29.420 --> 1:30:31.820\n You know, I am, you know,\n\n1:30:31.820 --> 1:30:33.740\n not only do I ardently support,\n\n1:30:33.740 --> 1:30:35.980\n you know, people thinking about that,\n\n1:30:35.980 --> 1:30:37.660\n I'm trying to think about it myself\n\n1:30:37.660 --> 1:30:41.420\n and have my students and postdocs think about it,\n\n1:30:41.420 --> 1:30:42.980\n but we should not pretend\n\n1:30:42.980 --> 1:30:45.420\n that those speed ups are already established.\n\n1:30:45.420 --> 1:30:49.300\n And the problem comes when so many of the companies\n\n1:30:49.300 --> 1:30:52.380\n and, you know, and journalists in this space\n\n1:30:52.380 --> 1:30:53.540\n are pretending that.\n\n1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:57.740\n Like all good things, like life itself,\n\n1:30:57.740 --> 1:31:00.540\n this conversation must soon come to an end.\n\n1:31:00.540 --> 1:31:04.620\n Let me ask the most absurdly philosophical last question.\n\n1:31:04.620 --> 1:31:07.500\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:11.540\n What gives your life fulfillment, purpose,\n\n1:31:11.540 --> 1:31:15.500\n happiness, and yeah, meaning?\n\n1:31:15.500 --> 1:31:18.860\n I would say, you know, number one,\n\n1:31:18.860 --> 1:31:22.420\n trying to discover new things about the world\n\n1:31:22.420 --> 1:31:25.380\n and share them and, you know, communicate\n\n1:31:25.380 --> 1:31:29.380\n and learn what other people have discovered.\n\n1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:33.540\n You know, number two, you know, my friends,\n\n1:31:33.540 --> 1:31:38.540\n my family, my kids, my students,\n\n1:31:40.620 --> 1:31:42.820\n you know, just the people around me.\n\n1:31:43.780 --> 1:31:46.780\n Number three, you know, trying, you know,\n\n1:31:46.780 --> 1:31:50.740\n when I can to, you know, make the world better\n\n1:31:50.740 --> 1:31:52.100\n in some small ways.\n\n1:31:52.100 --> 1:31:54.500\n And, you know, it's depressing that I can't do more\n\n1:31:54.500 --> 1:31:58.660\n and that, you know, the world is, you know,\n\n1:31:58.660 --> 1:32:01.100\n facing crises over, you know, the climate\n\n1:32:01.100 --> 1:32:04.460\n and over, you know, sort of resurgent authoritarianism\n\n1:32:04.460 --> 1:32:06.740\n and all these other things, but, you know,\n\n1:32:06.740 --> 1:32:10.580\n trying to stand against the things\n\n1:32:10.580 --> 1:32:13.180\n that I find horrible when I can.\n\n1:32:13.180 --> 1:32:16.060\n Let me ask you one more absurd question.\n\n1:32:16.060 --> 1:32:17.340\n What makes you smile?\n\n1:32:18.740 --> 1:32:20.660\n Well, yeah, I guess your question just did.\n\n1:32:20.660 --> 1:32:21.500\n I don't know.\n\n1:32:21.500 --> 1:32:25.740\n I thought I tried that absurd one on you.\n\n1:32:25.740 --> 1:32:28.580\n Well, it was a huge honor to talk to you.\n\n1:32:28.580 --> 1:32:30.740\n We'll probably talk to you for many more hours, Scott.\n\n1:32:30.740 --> 1:32:31.660\n Thank you so much.\n\n1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:32.500\n Well, thank you.\n\n1:32:32.500 --> 1:32:33.340\n Thank you.\n\n1:32:33.340 --> 1:32:34.500\n It was great.\n\n1:32:34.500 --> 1:32:36.220\n Thank you for listening to this conversation\n\n1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:37.260\n with Scott Aaronson.\n\n1:32:37.260

1:33:06.220\n from a funny and insightful blog post\n\n1:33:06.220 --> 1:33:08.500\n Scott wrote over 10 years ago\n\n1:33:08.500 --> 1:33:12.940\n on the ever present Malthusianisms in our daily lives.\n\n1:33:12.940 --> 1:33:14.860\n Quote, again and again,\n\n1:33:14.860 --> 1:33:17.060\n I've undergone the humbling experience\n\n1:33:17.060 --> 1:33:19.780\n of first lamenting how badly something sucks,\n\n1:33:19.780 --> 1:33:23.500\n then only much later having the crucial insight\n\n1:33:23.500 --> 1:33:25.180\n that it's not sucking\n\n1:33:25.180 --> 1:33:28.100\n wouldn't have been a Nash equilibrium.\n\n1:33:29.260 --> 1:33:30.580\n Thank you for listening.\n\n1:33:30.580 --> 1:33:50.580\n I hope to see you next time.\n\n"
